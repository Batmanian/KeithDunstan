The purity of the Sabbath Day was always a fine Anglican custom,
it was a fine Scottish custom, but incredibly it also thrived in the so-
called lusty, free and casy colonies of Australia and New Zcaland.
Yet of all colonial cities it thrived best in Melbourne. After all,
Melbourne rather felt that it had a superior moral tone to other
places, and even as late as 196 the city on Sundays had a certain
splendid solemnity about it.
The Melbourne Sunday was world famous, a tourist attraction
really, like trams and 6 o'clock closing. Where else on earth, with
the possible exception of Adelaide, could one find a city where
absolutely nothing happened, where the biggest excitement among
the citizens on a Sunday was to go either to the Botanic Gardens or
to Essendon Airport; an alternative of gazing in composed decorum
at the swans or in composed decorum at the Boeing 7275.
The late Brian Fitzpatrick once said that the Melbourne Sunday
had a tranquillity, a pure beauty, why, it was a work of art like the
Winged Victory of Samothrace, the Two Minutes' Silence, or La
Giaconda,.1
The truth is that our Winged Victory was perfect for a very long
time. William Kelly, a most entertaining Irishman, in his book
Life in Victoria painted his sketch of the Melburnian Sunday of the
I8jos, a sketch which could be taken as read for any Sunday for the
next 100 years.
For a new, rollicking, harum-scarum, devil-may-care country .
I
marvelled to witness the air of quiet serenity and decorousness which

16
THE EVIL OF THE DESECRATION OF THE SABBATH
pervaded the capital on the Sabbath morning . . . I could almost fancy
the cho of my footfall was reproving my trespass on the prevailing
stillness. Even when I got into Great Collins Street there was not a
soul astir.
In 1906, with less sympathy, John Norton gave his exasperated
howl in Truth.
It is neither a Scotch Sabbath nor a Jew's Sabbath neither a Christian
Sunday nor a white man's holiday; but a mixed up abortion of a
thing brought about through the promiscuous intercourse of all sorts
of sects and interests . .
Morning trains only carry folks to church,
trams will not run until afternoon.
And there shall be no drinking
in any hotel, and no selling of any Sunday newspapers or other pub-
lications and no charge for admission to any public entertainment .
How long, oh Lord, how long? asks the honest reformer, appealing
from all the domination of monkeydom, humbug and folly to the God
of reason and righteousness.?
Dr F. B. Smith in his 1956 thesis on the Sabbatarians felt that
the Presbyterians were the strongest influence in fighting for the
Melburnian Sunday. He said that after the Anglicans and the
Roman Catholics they were the third largest denomination during
the period 1874 to 19r0, and Victoria received 35 per cent more
Presbyterians and Scottish immigrants than any other State.? The
Roman Catholics kept well out of it, and the Anglicans fought only
in sporadic skirmishes. For example, the Anglican Bishop of Mel-
bourne, Bishop Moorhouse, thought there was no solid ecclesiastical
background for a solemn Sabbath.
We have a day of rest set apart in order that man may have an
opportunity of communion with his maker, but we have no explicit
directions for the observance of that day. The enlightened conscience
must decide for itself.*
Then there was the much quoted sermon of the Reverend John
Sutton, an Anglican minister of Brisbane, who said:
Neither in the New Testament, nor in the practice of apostolic times,
nor in the works of the Fathers of the Christian Church, nor in the
writings of the reformers, is there to be found the slightest warrant for
the Sabbatical day of rest. The Puritans have made what was meant
to be the most joyful day of the week, the most gloomy.

The most forceful argument put forward by the Sabbatarians
was that every man deserved, needed, and was entitled to his day
of rest. Therefore on Sunday the trains should not run, the public
buildings should not be open, the theatres should be closed, there
should be no selling of liquor, the newspapers should not publish,
even the Army should not hold manoeuvres, because if they opera-
ted, then they would have to employ Sunday labour. Later when
the trade unions became a force they agreed with all this, but most
of them were delighted to drop a principle to get double time or
time and a half on Sundays.
The Victorian Railways, at various periods, ran only sufficient
trains on Sunday to get the good people to and from Church. In
1871 the Presbyterian Journal Southern Cross noted the moral
dilemma, and decided they should stick to principle right through.
It was wrong even for Church goers to use trains on Sundays. They
should walk to Church, that is patronize churches in their neigh-
borhoods. If the preaching was not satisfactory there, then they
should move house and live closer to their favourite church.
The Sabbatarians rarely missed a trick. In 1856 the Sunday Obser-
vance Society of Geelong objected to the payment of wages on
Saturday afternoons, because this meant that workers made their
purchases on the Sunday, 'a positive evil'"
In 1855, the Reverend Dr Adam Cairns, the noted Presbyterian
preacher, complained that the Army had fired a gun salute on a
Sunday in honor of the birthday of Prince Albert. He wrote: I
confess my surprise gave way to a sense of shame that the law of
God and the best feelings of His people should have been distressed
and shocked by a disturbance for which not the shadow of a reason
can be alleged."
The Age in its noble desire to give the public the very latest in
overseas news brought out extraordinary editions on a Sunday on
the occasion of the arrival of the Lightning from England and the
Gertrude from Calcutta in 1855. The Society for Sabbath Observance
thought this an 'audacious violation of the Sabbath'.
There were bar sales of liquor on Sundays but the Government
stepped in and stopped it in 1854, despite the fact that 15,000 citizens
petitioned and wanted it to go on. The Sabbatarians staged a

splendid onslaught to get their way. The Moderator of the Free
Presbyterian Church, the Reverend M. Mackay, filled two columns
of the Argus with one letter, and mighty columns they were too.
We do solemnly declare, testify to you this day, Beloved Brethren, that
the blessing of God can never rest on the temporal gain or profit that
may be made by profaning the Sabbath. Woe unto him that striveth
with his maker. Who hath hardened himself against Him and hath
prospered?10
There was no limit to it. In 1871 there was a fearful row because
the fagship of Her Majesty's Victorian Navy, the Cerebus, was
thrown open for public inspection on Sundays." Then in 1876 an
Elder wrote to the Argus and complained of the shocking act of
Sabbath desecration of some little boys Aying kites at Emerald Hill.
It was high time public attention was directed to such iniquities' 12
Always Melbourne tried to keep the city free of any public enter-
tainment on Sundays, but it must be admitted a certain Mr Fair-
cough, in August 1875, hired the Town Hall for an evening of
sacred readings interspersed with instrumental music. The Mel-
bourne Society for the Promotion of Public Morality thought this
was just a disguise to provide entertainment, and the members
waited on the Mayor, to express their utmost indignation at the
'unholy prostitution of a public building'. The effect of the publicity
was to fill the hall to capacity. Even the aisles were filled with
standees. However the audience was most well-behaved. There were
occasions when it was moved to 'indulge in applause' but there were
signs around the hall pointing out that this was forbidden. The
solemnity of the Sabbath was maintained with silent hands,13
The Battle of the Trains continued, and the biggest danger of all
was excursion trains. The Railways ran the church trains, but the
Railways Commissioners always felt that if they could run a few
more Sabbath trains, their railways-renowned as a disastrous eco-
nomic venture-could perhaps earn a little more money. When
excursion trains started running to Queenscliff there were deputa-
tions of protest to the Ballarat City Council. One of the councillors
had the nerve to return the attack against the Most Reverend
Samuel Thornton, Anglican Bishop of Ballarat. He asked if His
Lordship were not breaking the Sabbath by employing his groom
and coachman on Sunday, and keeping his cook and servants at

work during the blessed day. According to the Bulletin' the Bishop
'gasped and squirmed', the Mayor broke in and apologized for the
indignity whereupon 'Dr Thornton blew his nose with a loud
report, looked resigned, and said he at least would take no further
notice of what had taken place'.
Even the Governor was in trouble. He was touring officially about
Victoria, yet he came under the lash of Dr Adam Cairns at the
18-- Presbyterian Assembly. He complained on behalf of the church
Committee on Sabbath Observance and Public Morality. The Gover.
nor's action, said he, could not fail to have a pernicious influence. In
moving the adoption of the report Dr Cairns said that 'the action of
His Excellency, Sir George Bowen, was indefensible and intolerable
and would never be sanctioned by Her Majesty, the Queen'.I
Perhaps the worst affair was the Sunday Railway picnic to Mount
Macedon in 1874. Over 1,500 railways workers went to the bush by
train. They had sports, they had four brass bands, they had dancing
and there were booths where liquor was served. Melbourne Punch
reported that everybody had such a good time that some had to be
left behind when the trains left that night, but yet they still turned
up at work the next day with the excuse lost in the bush, all night
Sir, and couldn't make anyone hear' 16
On 3 March, at the monthly meeting of Presbytery of Melbourne,
the Reverend Dr Cameron called it one of the greatest outrages ever
carried out under the sanction of Government, and called for a
deputation to the Chief Secretary. I
On 16 March, the Chief Secretary, received a formidable gather-
ing, Dr Adam Cairns, plus 18 other clergy and r7 laymen. The
Reverend J. C. Symons read a lengthy memorial that included:
That we believe, not only on the ground of divine authority, but also
from the national rights and liberties which should be enjoyed by
every citizen, that no man should, under any circumstances, be re-
quired to work on the Lord's Day for the mere pleasure of others;
and that especially the State should not require, or permit any of its
employes to engage in their ordinary work except when absolutely
necessary; nor should it hold out any inducements to them, nor afford
the facilities for violating the rest and sacredness of the Lord's Day, Is
The Chief Secretary, Mr Francis, said that all that was contem-
plated was just a run on the mountainside for the railway employees;

no one knew there were to be bands and scenes of debauchery. It
would not happen again.
The major battle, the Battle of Stalingrad of Sabbatarianism, was
over the opening of the Public Library and the National Gallery on
Sunday. This was an annual, as regular as the blooming of the
daffodils. The first unsuccessful attempts to have public buildings
open on Sunday were made in the i8os and altogether it was an
issue before Parliament, eighteen times.' Oddly enough the Zoo was
open on Sundays, although the Government had been careful. It cost
a shilling for adults and sixpence for children on the other days of
the week, but the feeling was that if admission was free on Sundays
then consciences were clear. Of course, Sunday was by far the most
popular day and 6,000 to 8,000 went through the Gardens,20 So it was
all right to look at monkeys on a Sunday, but not all right to read
a book or look at a picture.
In 1882 the Sabbatarians, at last, missed a trick. Two prominent
'Openers', Professor Pearson and Mr Bromley, were appointed to the
Board of Library Trustees. They waited until April the next year
when Parliament was in recess, then acted. They put up a motion
for Opening and it went through by one vote. This was a declaration
of war.
The leading Sabbatarians formed the Sunday Observance League
and issued a manifesto which contained the words: 'We assert the
supreme majesty of God's Sabbath law against its violators, nation
or individual. We will fight to the death for Sunday for every
toiler of the nation.
There were Town Hall meetings for and against. The Sunday
Liberation Society had a splendid roll-up in the Town Hall on 3
May. There were several clerics on the platform including the Rev.
Dr Bromby of St Paul's, the Rev. Charles Strong and the Reverends
'T. Capel S.J. and H. Daly S.J. Mr Strong said Sunday was not a
day of gloom. He had his best breakfast, his best dinner and best
supper on Sunday. 'You cannot possibly carry out the principle of
not doing any work on Sunday. Ministers must work on Sunday,
church officers, must work, the organist must work and the servants
in the house have some little work on Sunday,'l
There was a deputation to the Premier. He was told Sunday
schools would be depleted, but meanwhile the Gallery, Library and

Museum, which was open only during very non-church hours, 1.20
p.m. to 5 p.m. did nobly. On the first afternoon, 6,000 people went
through the turnstiles,23
Perhaps all would have been well had it not been for Chloc. Chloe
was the rather hippy, haughty nude, now in the saloon bar at
Young & Jackson's hotel, opposite St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne.
She was painted by the Chevalier Jules Lefebvre of Paris and
exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1876, where she won the Grand
Medal of Honour. A. M.?* records that George Moore in his
Confessions of a Young Man writes with faint contempt of Lefebvre
and Bouguereau', both painters of feshy, romantic nudes. And he
tells of a meeting with Marie, the model for Chloe: 'Her end was a
tragic one. She invited her friends to dinner, and, with the few pence
that remained, she bought some boxes of matches, boiled them, and
drank the water. No one knew why; some said it was love.'
Chloe came to Melbourne for the grand International Exhibition
of 1880 and was exhibited in the French Court as a fine example of
French art. The art critics were very kind, for, after all, she had
already been praised by the famous critic Anatole de Montaiglon
who spoke of 'the immaculate whiteness of her body' . . . 'the clean
immobility of her pause'. 'Everything is young and of the same
youth; the delicacy of the wrists and ankles, the slenderness of the
calves and legs, the virginity of the chest . . . it is indeed the precise
and chaste elegance which precedes the fullness of beauty, of which
it is the first flower.'2t
Dr Thomas Fitzgerald, later Sir Thomas, the distinguished sur-
geon of the Melbourne Hospital, bought the picture and in 1882 he
offered it on loan to the National Gallery. There was no fuss until
the 'Opening' controversy, and then on 7 May 1883, this letter
appeared in the Argus.
Sir.-I highly approve of the determination of the trustees of our
picture gallery to open it to the public on Sunday, and would suggest
that the indecent picture of a naked woman called by a classical name,
which hangs in the north-east corner of the gallery should at once be
removed. Would any of the gentlemen trustees permit a nude picture
of their daughter, or sister, to be hung there; and if not, why anyone
else's daughter? . .. The visitors to the Gallery are in proportion of at
least three females to one male, and all the pictures in the neighbor-

THE EVIL OF THE DESECRATION OF THE SABBATH
hood of this particular one have to be passed by, for no decent woman
with her daughters would dare to stop in front of it. For whose delec-
tation is it hung there? It may safely be said not for female visitors and
therefore it must be for males, young and old, and only those of
vicious proclivities. No artist has yet painted and exhibited a naked
woman naturally, and probably never will.

Next day there was a letter signed by eight art students, some of
whom were to become very famous in Australian art.
Sir.-We the undersigned students fecling deeply the foolish and
injudicious remarks of your correspondent, Mr John Russell, think it is
our duty in the cause of art to protest against his sweeping condemna-
tion of a work so pure and elevating in sentiment and masterly in
execution as M. Lefebvre's picture of 'Cloe'. We wonder how your
correspondent or his female relatives managed to get so far into the
building as the Picture Galley, considering that there are two nude
female figures guarding the entrance.
His objection on the score of its being the portrait of someone's
daughter or sister is scarcely worth answering, as it would apply with
equal or greater force to each of the many nude figures which abound
in our sculpture gallery, while, as to the objection to ladies standing
before it, surely this would apply to the nude figures of males, of
which we possess several.
As students and lovers of art are not notorious for their evil and
would be the last to wish to see anything in any way bordering on
the indecent in our Gallery, but maintain that in the present case any
indecency whatever exists only in the remarks of your correspondent.

The correspondence thrived for a month. One correspondent said
that he knew of a lady who heard objectionable remarks being
made by young men standing in front of Chloe and for this reason
he thought the picture should be removed. Yet at the same time it
would be impossible to banish from all our art collections those

pictures which displayed the human form. Therefore he made this
suggestion. There should be a special room for such art, to which
nobody under a certain age should be admitted. Also there should
be separate hours, one for males and one for females. If this were
arranged then the 'possibility of circumstances such as those alluded
to above could not occur' 25
Indeed many worried over this terrible thought of male and
female looking at the undraped form at the same time. Heaven
knows what might result from this:
Sir.-Most people will allow that the Chloe cannot be admired by a
brother and sister together, nor yet by a lover and a sweetheart, and
a picture which thus scatters a family party is out of place in a collec-
ton which is supposed to be more for the recreation and education
of the people than as a school of art for students.
I am, etc.
MATRON26
"Can it be right', asked A Mother, 'that a mother cannot take her
young daughter to a public gallery, never to speak of her sons, with-
out feeling her cheeks tingling with shame?'
Decency thought that as Chloe was only a temporary visitor to the
Gallery, she should be made more respectable. True, clothes could
not be painted on her, but a modern costume could be draped
around the picture. Then why not make the marble statues decent,
a suit of tweed and a felt hat for Antinous and a blanket for the
recumbent Bacchante?
Yet perhaps the most charming of the letters received was this:
Sir.-It seems to me that the picture has a strictly and positively moral
tendency in promoting the cause of matrimony. 'The artist shows us
(I write as a bachelor) what a really beautiful thing a young maiden
is-a matter that I am sure you will agree with me in stating we can
otherwise know nothing of except by hearsay, and I maintain that if
anything can fan the incipient sparks of affection into such a flame of
love or shall induce a young man to go straightway and commit
matrimony, it is the sight of Chloe.
I am, yours etc.
T.D.I.27
The Bulletin in Sydney was amused at the incredible exhibition
of modesty in Melbourne and wrote:

THE EVIL OF THE DESECRATION OF THE SABBATH
But Chloe, Nature fully knows
you're
Purest in her suit,
She scorns all sham in-chloe-sure,
Corset, bustle, boot.
You have no faults, Chloe, to
Chloe-the-over,
With you a god might live in
Chloe-ver!
27
On 26 May the Argus decided to close the correspondence and in
a leading article the newspaper said:
What is to be done with this shameless minx Chloe, who for all the
innocence of her looks is, we are assured, a most corrupting and de-
moralising personage? Shall she be banished from all place of public
resort as an improper person or be made to attire herself as a girl of
the period?
Word came through on 29 May that Chloe was to be withdrawn
from public exhibition. Dr Fitzgerald, who lent the picture, had
now asked for its return. The Trustees, no doubt, were immensely
relieved that this problem, at least, was out of their hands.23
However the Sabbatarians by the extraordinary publicity had
made Chloe's reputation for all time. When Sir Thomas Fitzgerald
died in 1908, Young & Jackson's Princes Bridge Hotel bought the
picture from his estate for £800 and put it on display in the saloon
bar. Chloe has been there ever since except for a period during the
First World War when she was exhibited for the Red Cross. She
raised £300 at sixpence a head admission. There is no record of her
tingling any cheeks with shame at Young & Jacksons and she is now
Melbourne's number one tourist attraction with perhaps just the
edge on the stuffed figure of the racehorse Phar Lap at the Museum.
Chloe may have been withdrawn but the Sunday Opening battle
was far from over. There were mass meetings For and Against in
the Melbourne Town Hall, at Fitzroy, Collingwood and Prahran.
For example, at the Melbourne Town Hall the Reverend W. H.
Fitchett said that if the galleries were opened on Sundays the
theatres would soon be opened, and soon the colony would be like
other countries where the ring of the hammer was heard and the
smoke of the chimney stacks was seen on the Sabbath Day, 29

28
THE EVIL OF THE DESECRATION OF THE SABBATH
Ar the Prahran Town Hall the Reverend Murdoch Macdonald
moved: That this meeting believing Sunday to be a day given by
God for worship and rest, protests against the opening of the Public
Library, Art Gallery and Museum, and the consequent needless
national employment of labor on that day as being a violation of
Divine Law and of human right."
Some of the meetings were very lively indeed. On 4 June there
was a meeting in support of Opening at the Fitzroy Town Hall and
the Mayor, Cr James Moore, was on the platform. A week later there
was another meeting, this time in protest. The Mayor once more
was on the platform, but this time he made it clear that he was only
present "in compliance with a requisition' and his views were well
known. The Reverend Nye, a Wesleyan, opened the meeting with
prayer and there were hisses and yells. First there was a resolution
in favour of keeping the Library closed, then Cr McMahon moved
the amendment: "That in the opinion of this meeting the opening
of the Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery on a Sunday after-
noon is a Christian movement tending to promote the moral and
intellectual improvement of the people.
There was an uproar. According to the Argus Thomas Walker, a
lecturer, made a move towards the platform, after having sent up
a note saying he wished to speak to the amendment. He was met
by two or three gentlemen who told him he would not be allowed
to speak, but Mr Walker rushed on. The Argus said:
He was violently pushed off the platform and in an instant the meeting
was broken up. After Mr Walker was knocked over a body of his
supporters rushed to his defence. The Mayor's table was pushed aside,
several blows were struck, two or three women at the rear of the hall
fainted, and the lights were extinguished. Mr Walker was put on the
platform again but he advised them to disperse.30
Of course, Parliament was showered with petitions of every kind.
The Openers collected 38,000 signatures for Opening as against
11,000 by the Sabbatarians. Yet, as Dr F. B. Smith said, the Sabbath
petitions were more impressive because they were more persistent
and they came from hundreds of small towns and congregations.?]
It was easy to have a petition to be signed on a Church door, but hunting for them around hotel bars, football grounds and 
door to door.

The whole issue came up for debate in the Legislative Assembly
on A July. Mr W. J. Shiels, a future premier, gave one of the great
speeches of his career. He traced the history of the Jewish Sabbath,
the Christian Sabbath, and he quoted all the leading theologians of
the day. He even quoted Thackeray:
The poor man's sins are glaring;
In the face of ghostly warning,
He is caught in the fact
Of an overt act
Buying greens on a Sunday morning.
shiel's passionate plea had little effect. At just on I a.m. the
following morning the House passed a resolution which castigated
the Library Trustees for exceeding their prerogative in opening the
Institution on Sundays and added the lines: Further, that the
trustees be called upon to immediately revert to the original practice
and close the institutions under their charge on Sundays until Parlia-
ment shall otherwise determine.' The vote was 35 to 12.32
Yet the anti-Sabbatarians, despite their defeat, did have a final
laugh. That very weekend the 'magnificent new Liverpool liner', the
George Roper, 2033 tons, went aground at Point Lonsdale in very
heavy seas. On the Saturday there was a public auction of the wreck
and it was bought by a syndicate which included Mr Bruce, of the
firm Paterson, Laing & Bruce, Mr Hugh Thompson, Mr John
Blyth, Mr Edward Duckett, Mr J. M. Robison, Mr Thomas Robi-
son and a Mr Campbell. The cargo value was estimated at £50,000
and at daybreak on Sunday, with a chartered vessel and a gang of
10 fishermen, many of these gentlemen set out to salvage what they
could from the George Roper. But the point was this: most of the
names had been on petitions for the closing of the Public Library
and Gallery on Sunday, and Mr Bruce, in particular, was a leading
Sabbatarian.
On 10 July Mr Shiels facetiously asked the Premier if he were
prepared to bring in a bill to prevent such goings on taking place on
a Sunday,38 The Bulletin was most caustic:
So [the Sabbatarians ] chartered a steamer and sent her down the Bay
on a Sunday to save as much as they could from the stranded vessel.
The weather was rough and a good few men had a narrow squeak for
their lives, but then didn't the purchasers strike a patch! And that's

Ar chis time public libraries, art galleries and museums were open
on Sundays in Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, Dunedin, Christchurch,
Wellington, and even in Bendigo and Ballarat. In 1886 the Age*
set out to show the extraordinary contrast between Melbourne and
sydney. Not only was everything open from the Library to the
Wechanics Institute but there was all manner of entertainment to be
had on Sunday nights. It was interesting to glance down the
columns to note the places of amusement which were in active
competition with the churches. At the Theatre Royal there was a
'grand concert and oration'; at West's Academy there was a musical
programme followed by a spiritualistic lecture; at the Royal Stan-
dard Theatre there was an address on 'The Sun and What We Owe
It; the Academy of Music was occupied by a gentleman who gave
poetical lectures illustrated by imitations of well-known actors,
orators, etc, and on top of this four straight concerts were advertised.
Melburnians, however, were unconcerned as to what was done
in other cities, and although there were opening campaigns right
through the eighteen-nineties, Parliament did not legislate for the
opening of the Library, Gallery and Museum until 22 September
1904 and Melbourne was the last city in the British Empire to re-
ceive this service.
Even now Melbourne does not have Sunday newspapers. Apart
from Hober it is the an is unralia ca pine start a aca,*nor have
have them. Parliament banned Sunday newspapers in Victoria such
a long time ago, few people know why or how it ever came about.
In 1876 there was a Sunday newspaper in Melbourne called
Gossip which ran for only a few issues, but in 1889 there was the
threat of a new newspaper, the Sunday Times, and the Government
felt the old Police Offences Statute which covered Sunday trading
was insufficiently strong, so Mr H. Wrixon, often called Mr Right-
cous Wrison, brought down the Sunday Newspapers Bill.
One of the main reasons for the Bill was this, Mr. Wrixon said:
In the publication and sale of Sunday newspapers large numbers of
boys must be employed who would attend where people mostly con-

gregated, that was near the churches, and there, by shouting out the
sames of their papers, and perhaps the latest horror upon which they
relied to sell the paper, they would become a perfect nuisance to al
peaceful and law abiding citizens.
The Bulletin commented: Mr Wrixon must indeed be as ignorant
as he is rich and puritanical if he imagines that anything more than
an insignificant minority of the adult male population attends
Church on Sundays,'36
Mr L. L. Smith on behalf of the Opposition said that it was
impossible to argue for the bill on religious grounds. If they thought
they were stopping Sabbath labour by stopping Sunday newspapers,
then they were wrong. Sunday newspapers were set up by composi
tors who worked on Saturday nights and Monday newspapers were
produced by men who worked on Sunday nights. Perhaps it would
have been better had they legislated against Monday newspapers.
Then the question was raised about the Daily Telegraph, a Mel.
bourne morning daily which was produced with Church backing
However Mr Balfour, a leading Sabbatarian, pointed out that no-
body on the Daily Telegraph worked between midnight Saturday
and midnight Sunday. The result of this was that much of the
Telegraph's Sunday news did not get into the newspaper until
Tuesday, possibly a contributing factor to the collapse of the
Telegraph under the first strains of the Land Boom in 182. The
Sunday Newspapers' Bill became law in 1889 and has remained the
law in Victoria ever since.37
Over the years, Melbourne continued to battle for its work of art.
Although the law against Sunday trading was strict it was never
quite possible to keep people out of the hotels. The Southern Cross
in 188238 said that every pub in Bourke Street had its back door
open on Sundays. The Dean of Rochester announced that Sunday
should be spent in preparing for eternity of which it was really a
pre-taste.>® Certainly the Melbourne Sunday often seemed that way.
In 1900 a barber was fined five shillings# for shaving a man on
Sunday and the Police dug out an Act of Charles Il, under which
to charge him. There were sermons against the new craze for cycling
which took people out of the city on the Sabbath nor were the new
motion pictures receiving the blessing of the pulpit. In 1911 the Fitz-
roy Council cancelled the registration of the Fitzroy Cyclorama for

its Sunday entertainments. Cr Langdon appealed to no avail that the
people who went to the Cyclorama were quite as respectable as
those who went to Church. They were giving shows at 3.30
pam. and 8 p.m, a sacred concert with well-known artists and 10,000
Feet of biograph pictures:. One noticed from the ads. that they also
offered a Red' Indian Story titled The Rescue of Molly Finney

ways Minister, Mr R. G. Menzies, against the running of Sunday
excursion trains. Mr W. H. Edgar MC, who led the deputation,
said the demoralizing propaganda that the railways used over the
radio ways to advertise these excursions contaminated the cars of
decent people. Until this unfortunate business is stopped, I will not

There was a slow metamorphosis of the Melbourne Sunday. In
1928 the Brighton Council banned golf at Elsternwick Park on
Sundays, and this sort of thing provided good debate material until
1947 when there was a referendum in Melbourne's largest suburban
city, the middleclass headquarters of respectability, Camberwell. The
ratepayers were asked: 'Are you in favor of non-commercialized
sport approved by Camberwell City Council being played on muni-
cipal reserves on Sundays?' The answer was a fairly resounding 'no'
-a majority of 1771, out of 9,000 votes. In that year out of 12 coun-
cils, only two, Richmond and Fitzroy, permitted sport to be played
on Sundays. Camberwell reversed its former decision by a two to
one vote in 1959.
In July 1965 Victoria made legal Sunday picture shows "after
Evensong', and the Reverend Sir Irving Benson of the Methodist
Church commented: What is coming next? Could it be that we will
soon be having horse racing, night trotting after 9 p.m, and the
hotels open for trade? Is this what our Parliaments and councils
want?"3
What next? Well, next was commercialized sport on Sundays
upon application to the Chief Secretary, and this became legal after
I March 1g68. The Chief Secretary, Mr Rylah, introduced a special
Sunday Entertainment Bill and he said the purpose of this was to

remove from the statute book the 1780-1 Act of George III, which
was called 'an Act for Preventing Certain Abuses and Profanations
on the Lord's Day, Called Sunday."14
This was the real basis of the Melburnian winged Victory and it
said:
.. any house, room or other place which shall be opened for public
entertainment or amusement, or for publicly debating on any subject
whatsoever upon any part of the Lord's Day, and to which persons
shall be admitted by the payment of money, shall be deemed a dis-
orderly home or place.
Actually some profanations had been going on for some time.
There was a way around the old Act. Instead of demanding money
at the turnstiles, sporting organizations "accepted donations'. In the
196os Olympic Park was a regular 'disorderly house' for soccer and
there was even a little disorderly housing at such august places as
the Kooyong Tennis Club.
There was surprisingly little protest against the Sunday Entertain-
ment Bill and with its introduction the perfect tranquillity of the
Melbourne Sunday was at end. It is said that the very second when
the Governor signed his assent to the bill there was a warm sigh
from Chloe in the saloon bar at Young & Jackson's hotel. Perhaps
even at this late stage she saw promise of her return to the National
Gallery. Yet that might be too much of a risk. It could give play to
no end of vicious proclivities.
