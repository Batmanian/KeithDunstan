THERE'S nothing very new in writing stunt columns. There's a columnist in Hawaii who specializes in the most daring of adventures. One day he accused the women of Honolulu of being lazy, of having little to do. The response was satisfactorily devastating, and, if I remember correctly, one mother invited him to take over her menage for twenty-four hours, while she moved out to a hotel. She left behind her ten children. This Hawaii columnist found plenty of material for his column that day.

The stunt column has the beautiful advantage in that one is right inside the story, taking part. There is no second-hand information, it is all first hand, it makes for much more lively copy. So over the years I have performed as a second at the wrestling, as an extra in grand opera, as Father Christmas at a city store, led a recalcitrant Santa Gertrudis bull around the arena at the Show, been blasted off an aircraft carrier by steam catapult, been frightened in racing cars and galloped in the tail of a Chinese dragon.

The night at the wrestling was most educational. You see, Primo Carnera, 6 ft 6 in., 21 stone, former heavyweight boxing champion of the world, now wrestler, was in town. He turned out to be a gentle character with a nice sense of humour, but as a man to see he was awe-inspiring. His hands were twice the size of a dinner plate and when he spoke his voice sounded as if it came from the bottom of a keg. At his hotel a room clerk looked at him open-mouthed, as if suddenly he had spotted a gorilla.

Carnera pulled a face and gave a roar: 'AAAAGGGGHHHHG!'

The poor clerk yelped and fled around the other side of the counter.

Carnera, we were told, despite his big frame, was a sparse eater, but he had a ravenous thirst. He caused his second stir at the hotel by ordering a large beer jug full of water. He took it in his big hand and sank it at one draught. Australians are always impressed by anyone who can do that. 

It was that afternoon that I volunteered to take the job as a second. Mr Carnera already was catered for, so I won a job with his opponent Stanley 'Murder Inc.' Kowalski, a Polish-American. A half hour before the fight my man Stanley was in the changing room. He was a big boy, 6 ft 4 in., 20 stone, with long peroxide blond hair. He was wearing black tights. 

'The tights are the trade mark of me and my mate, Tiny Mills,' he said. 'They call us Murder Incorporated. We got one golden rule: 'Do it to him before he does it to us.' Yair, I'm a main eventer, what they call a top hand. If you're in show business you're the top banana, in wrestling you're the top hand. 
 
'But in wrestling you get a real schizoid personality. You're one guy in the ring, a completely different guy out of it. The only top hand that's the same alla time is Gorgeous George. That man really hates people to muss up his hair. 

'He doesn't like me because I peroxide my hair like he does, I roughed him up real good a coupla times. He's only a little guy — about 14 stone.' 

It was almost time to go on. We discussed how everything was against us, a house full of Italians all in love with their idol, Primo Camera; none of our mob there, no good Polacks from Minnesota. 

Primo came on as big as a telegraph pole in a red and blue dressing gown, they cheered and yelled 'PRIMO! PRIMO!' We came on — my man Stanley in a very nice black and white silk jacket with a gold thread through it — and they booed and hissed. 

Stanley, of course, was insulted. He jumped into the ring, stamped his fist: 'YOU PEASANTS, YOU IGNORANT . . . I give you the bottom of my foot!' 

Maybe everything would have been all right if only things had stopped there, but some members of the Italian community arrived with a sheaf of flowers. It was perfectly understandable in the circumstances. My man Stanley was outraged. 'WHERE ARE MY FLOWERS ? WHY DON'T I GET ANY ? I'LL KILL HIM.' 

Bonny Muir, the referee, gave his instructions and Carnera advanced. Actually he hulked forward, rolling his shoulders in a fearsome manner. I shrank behind the corner post. If you ever plan to be a second at one of these bouts take my advice and latch on to the corner post — it's a good spot. You'll never get hit by a falling body. 

Stanley didn't hesitate. He flew at Carnera. He rained blows on him, pulled his hair. Carnera most unfairly pulled his hair back. My man had more than Carnera had. 

At one stage Carnera picked up Stanley and dumped him on the floor. As Stanley pointed out later, this was unpleasant. Seeing that Carnera was such a mountain of a man he dropped him from a remarkable height. Carnera took my man in a headlock and punched him in the face. He threw him out of the ring. There was no justice. 

Then Carnera scored a fall. It was like the last trump. The Italians cheered, whooped, threw kisses, jumped on their seats. 'PRIMO, PRIMO, BRAVO, PRIMO.' 

My man, understandably disappointed, beat the floor with his fists. I gave him a bottle of water and he poured it over his head. 

Several minutes later Stanley came back and pinned the huge Carnera. We could have been in church. There wasn't a sound. Nobody cheered. I said: 'Stanley, why are there no cheers?' 

'You want to hear them?' he said. He stepped back into the middle of the ring and blew a beautiful kiss to the gallery. The crowd whistled, they screeched, they threw cigarette boxes, and the noise was almost too loud to bear. That, I think, was the beginning of the end. 

Stanley now was most irritated. With superb skill he managed to get Carnera's neck twisted in the ropes. Then he picked him up by the legs and sat on him so that further pressure might be applied to Primo's neck. Bonny Muir, surprisingly, thought this unsporting. He pulled my man Stanley off by the hair. What else could Stanley do? He turned around and dropped the referee with a rabbit killer. 

I wish you could imagine the noise while this was going on. It was very loud. Bonny Muir then disqualified Stanley. Stanley wouldn't be disqualified. He tore into Carnera and they exchanged blows. Bonny Muir separated them and Stanley — in quite a nice way, you understand — picked him up and threw him out of the ring. 

Bonny Muir came back with another referee and there was some confusion. My man Stanley grabbed the microphone and pointed out the terrible injustice, how they had been robbed, how it was written in the contract that there were to be no disqualifications. 

Alas, we had to retire and we went down below to the dressing rooms. Naturally I assumed at once that schizoid Mr Kowalski would resume his former personality, but he was furious. Bonny Muir didn't understand. It was agreed by everybody that there were to be no disqualifications. It was in the contract. Muir ought to understand that. He was a former wrestler. He only gave him a rabbit killer and threw him out of the ring. 

Half an hour later Stanley was still angry. 

We wuz definitely robbed. 

After the wrestling it seemed wise to go for something a little more genteel, so I applied for a job as linesman at the professional tennis at Kooyong. There was some fear as to whether this would affect my amateur status at the local tennis club, but Jack Cullen, secretary of the Victorian Lawn Tennis Umpires' Association, put my mind at ease. He said they were all true blue amateurs, and the professionals made a general contribution to Association funds to assist in training. 

Actually umpires were suffering at the time. They were being accused, bitterly, by tennis players on all sides. There was even the case of the viewer who picked Neale Fraser's footfault during the U.S. Nationals at Forest Hills. This armchair linesman saw the footfault perfectly clearly on his TV and he sent a telegram of protest to Forest Hills. This was a record, the first man to disagree with a linesman from 1000 miles off. He was in Minnesota. 

At 7.30 p.m. I gathered with the other linesmen under the main grandstand at Kooyong. Jack Cullen gave us our instructions. Linesmen never called unless there was an error, he said, so they were allowed to say only FAULT, FOOTFAULT or OUT as the situation required. Anything said at any other time would stop the play. 

Linesmen do not clap or pass remarks. Though there is nothing in the book against elevating one's eyebrow every so often. The big moment came. We all looked very natty, wearing dark blue blazers. We formed into a platoon and keeping perfect step we marched onto the court. To one side stood the czar of tennis promotion, Jack Kramer, unsmiling, he was running his eye across the not overcrowded grandstands. As an American sports writer once put it: 'He is the only tennis player who can smash a ball away for a winner, count the house, and check the weather in the next town on his circuit, all at the one time.' 

I was on the service line with Frank Doczy, an amiable Hungarian, a Doctor of Literature and a Doctor of Laws. It is a very good thing to have a Doctor of Laws on the service line. 

The match between Alex Olmedo and Frank Sedgman went through smoothly. Frank Sedgman is the last of the gentleman players. Other professionals when they miss shots are apt to make remarks that wither the grass. Sedgman this night came out with old world comments like 'Oh gee' or 'Darn it'. Perhaps that is the reason why Olmedo won 11-9, 6-1. 

The serious match was between Lew Hoad and Pancho Segura. And Lew was far from happy. He had a down-at-the-mouth Robert Mitchum look about him. The balls weren't right, the court was wet, he was falling over on his spikes and it seemed the only way to overcome his frustrations was to thrash his service. The first few services came with the speed of light, except that there wasn't much light. It was night time and the rain was falling steadily. I peered into the gloom. `Mmm . . . I think that went in.' Somehow the linesman's job seemed much easier two hundred yards up in the grandstand, even easier in Minnesota. 

When the ball went out we called 'FAULT!' and when it didn't go out we said nothing. Now after almost every serve Pancho was looking at us with great Latin-American thunder. He was talking to himself too : 'Oh Pancho . . . watch the ball Pancho. . . . Move your legs Pancho.' 

There was a clean ace from Lew and Pancho shook his fist at us. I started to get a guilt complex. I mean the ball had been in front of us for only one thousandth of a second. And when one thought about it, who knows, maybe it could have been half an inch further over . . . 

Pancho won the first set 6-3, and it was 7-7 in the second set. Things couldn't have been more grim. Mr Hoad was sending guided missiles through the mist. Suddenly Pancho stormed up to our line and said: 'Which of you two is supposed to be watching the line? That's the third you've missed — out by a mile.' 

I was about to say something when Frank Doczy gripped my arm. He said nothing and gave Pancho a lovely, mysterious Mona Lisa smile. So that's how I learned to be a tennis linesman . . . never concede anything, give only mysterious Mona Lisa smiles. If we made any mistakes that night we made them with fearless impartiality. Pancho won that last set 8-6. 


The linesman job was interesting, but if I could call on the gods to give me some special gift I would ask to be a great tenor. It is always the tenor who finishes up with the girl, and the tenors always look so immensely happy when singing. I was determined somehow or other to get into opera and Stefan Haag of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust finally agreed to give me a job in the chorus of Lohengrin at Melbourne's 'Her Majesty's Theatre'. 

Mr Haag, however, was particularly cruel. He said: 'All right, I let you do this on one condition and one condition only ... that you don't sing. I shall expect you to open your mouth at the right times, but not a sound must come forth from your lips. But for heaven's sake look as if you're singing. One couldn't help but feel deeply about this because opportunities to sing with the Victorian Symphony Orchestra come all too rarely.

My role was that of a squire which called for a helmet, a rather imposing red cloak and chain mail which went from my top right down to my toes. Actually the chain mail was made from heavy weave knitted nylon. Chain mail has definitely come on since medieval times. 

The vast Wagnerian assembly gathered on the stage before the curtain. It was like the count down for a blast-off at Cape Kennedy. Over the microphone a voice said: Three minutes to curtain .. . Two minutes to curtain. There were Saxon gentlemen with shields, pikes, spears, swords, shields, halberds ... we had enough armour on stage at Her Majesty's to conquer Vietnam. 

The tension was just mounting when a bearded pike in the second row said: 'I see Flash Gordon's on tonight.' 

'Who's Flash Gordon?'

'That's Eric Clapham, the conductor. He's a beauty. You should see him go. We'll be through by 10:30 tonight.' 

The curtain went up and the light was blinding. I had imagined in the old tradition that I would be able to pick out some attractive person in the eighth row and sing my non-noises especially to her, but I couldn't see past the first row. 

We all took up our correct infantry positions. Simon Jochic, another squire, was standing beside me to dig me in ribs whenever we had to do anything. Quickly it became apparent that a squire's job was similar to that of an umpire at a cricket match — to take all the surplus material from the players. At various times we held banners, swords, shields. 

There were moments of magic, when as a frustrated O.R. in the chorus, I envied the singing of Lohengrin (Ronald Dowd) and Elsa (Elizabeth West), but eventually the agony began to tell. It was insufferably hot under the lights and the sweat was bubbling up under the Max Factor. I had nothing on under my uniform, but it is not generally appreciated just how much nylon chain mail can itch. We were suppose to stand there in one spot for thirty minutes without moving a muscle. Trickles were running down my spine and my whole back was a seething itch. If only I could have had just one good scratch. The halberd would have made a beautiful back scratch. The only way was to get my mind off it, somehow, worry about something more grievous. So I worried whether the Magpie rucks would be able to handle Barassi on Saturday. 

Act Two was a quiet one for the NCOS and pike holders, so we stayed below in the changing rooms. The chorus, as it is usually is these times, was made up almost entirely of Continentals — Italians, Hungarians, Czechs. . . . And this was the fascinating part, it wasn't just a job, they really adored to sing. So all the time they were down below during the second act, they never stopped, song after song. At one stage they burst into the Toreador song from Carmen. It was tremendous, so much so, they almost shook the rafters and it was a wonder that the audience didn't hear it. There was something quite moving about their enthusiasm. 

The most beautiful arias came during the last act, during the love scene between Lohengrin and Elsa. Now there was silence back stage and members of the cast gathered in the wings to listen. Some of them quietly hummed and mouthed the words. 

But deep among the wire cables and scenery over in the back-ground I spotted a big Saxon most passionately kissing a Plantagenet-looking maiden. It seemed to fit the situation. 

Once again we all had to mass on stage and the climax came. Elsa had broken her vow and asked the forbidden question as to Lohengrin's identity. Therefore he would have to leave forever, and the great Swan would bear him back to Montsalvat. 

During this aria I had to stand beside the silver knight and look sympathetic. He sang so well I could see it all. Ronald Dowd was utterly transported, he had projected himself into the part and he really was Lohengrin, the silver knight. It was just then that the straps around his calves began to come undone, releasing the armor, which was meant to protect his shins. 

So he would announce in his beautiful tenor voice: 'I AM LOHENGRIN, SON OF PARSIFAL', then whisper to me: 'Can you see it, what's happening?' 

'It's all falling off, Mr Dowd.'

'Bugger it, the flaming thing.'

So he went on to tell how he came to Monsalvat, where stood the Temple of the Holy Grail, and during every pause he passed remarks that weren't entirely suited to a silver knight. 

Finally one dropped off with a clatter, he shook it off. 'Oh s--' said he. Yet superbly he transported himself again to sing 'Oh My Faithful Swan', which was waiting to bear him off yonder. So came the climax, trumpets, orchestra, the collapse of Elsa and the final disappearance of the Swan. And as the curtain came down a fellow squire said to me: 'Did you ever hear the old classic Lohengrin story? Lohengrin was due to arrive on stage, see, resplendent and riding on his swan. Well, he'd had a jar or two, he slipped, didn't get on and the swan arrived on stage without him. So he turned to the stage manager and said, "What time does the next swan leave ?" '

Again it became a tradition to find some stunt for getting into the Moomba Festival parade. One year the Myer Emporium had the idea of putting a fair dinkum cable tram into the parade, something most Melburnians hadn't seen for more than twenty-five years. They had great trouble in getting one. It turned out that Victoria was getting very light on cable trams, but eventually they found the article, in a school yard at Mount Eliza. 

So Myers restored it to the last dear old knob, to the last lovable piece of scroll work. They even put the bell back on top. It had been the official school bell at Mount Eliza. We took up our position in the procession and the tram looked splendid. Naturally it wasn't operating under cable power but it had very small bogey wheels underneath to look as if it really was riding on tram rails. My job was gripman and I wore cream trousers, an ivy-league blazer and a straw boater. As gripman it was important to study the old instructions, still readable, On the tram doors: LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE ALIGHTING, NO STANDING ON PLATFORM, and PASSENGERS MUST NOT TALK TO THE GRIP-MAN. I wasn't so keen on that one. 

It was possible to go all over town for twopence. A workman's return ticket was threepence and there was another odd sign : 'Passengers who break windows are requested to pay the conductor 2/6.' That was only for side windows, though. Anyone who wished to break door windows had to pay 4/-. 

Just before 11 a.m. we got under way. One gentleman by the side of the road started wailing: `Ah Memoreeeees, Memoreeees' and I shouted in the cable tram grippie style, 'HOLD ON FOR THE CURVE, PLEASE', and rang the bell repeatedly. It was a tremendously satisfying bell to ring. 

You must realize that Melbourne is a great tram city, one of the last places in Australia where there are even electric trams. So everywhere there were appreciative, smiling faces and I'll never forget a dignified, not-so-young, tramways inspector who walked out and with great dignity, took off his hat, and bowed stiffly from the waist. Just when I was convinced that it was a matter of weeks before the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board made a sensible return to cable trams, an awful thing happened. There was an appalling grinding noise underneath. One of the small wheels under the dummy got caught in the rails for the electric trams. 

There was a lurch, a screech of pain, and we sank down on the port side and we were out of the procession almost before we had started. We were left derelict by the side of the road. Our worst moment came when the big State Electricity Commission float trundled by. One felt that they might have had the decency to hide their banner: ELECTRICITY MAKES YOUR HOME A DREAM CASTLE. 

You will be interested to hear that the Tramways Board did not come to our aid. Finally Myers rustled up a tow car and we were shifted back to the marshalling yard. For a moment I was tempted to have a beer to help me to forget, but I didn't dare. Taking alcohol while in charge of a cable car is a most serious offence. The next year it seemed wise to go for something more reliable. 

Why not the Chinese community's 120 foot long dragon? This dragon, old, bejewelled and magnificent, was a regular at all parades. If I walked inside it I could get the real inside story. I rang Chinese gentlemen all around town. They all suggested it was rather impossible. They were polite, but roles in the dragon were sought after, it was an honour to be there, and a great tradition with the Chinese. It was even suggested that it would be quite sacrilegious for a non-Chinese to even touch the dragon. But eventually I found Mr Frank Chinn, president of the Young Chinese League, and, bless him, he said 'Yes'. 

Where would I like to go ? — Up at the head or down by the tail. I thought that down at the tail would be rather nice.

'You realize,' he said, 'that we have to carry the dragon about two and a half miles ?' 
'Oh, yes. 
'All right, then. Bring along a pair of football shorts, T-shirt, running shoes and a towel for a shower afterwards.' 
Even then I didn't realize how ominous it all sounded. 

We assembled on Moomba morning, took out our dragon and put it together piece by piece. It was a magnificent creature with enormous head, flashing eyes, tongue, and jaw that moved. All the way down its midriff, the length of several cricket pitches, were bamboo hoops to be supported by team members. Then finally came the tail, an affair almost as massive as the head and weighing at least twenty-five pounds. 

It was explained that I would be one of a team of four that would support the tail. 'You go in relays,' my mentor said. 'You watch the next fellow. As soon as it looks as if he can't carry on any longer you rush in and take over.' 

'What do you mean ?' I said. 'Is it that hard? The Moomba procession only goes at a walk.' 'You'll see,' said he, with a charming, enigmatic Oriental smile. 

Oh, dear reader, I didn't realize that the dragon had to writhe and squirm. Seeing that it was 120 feet long, what started as a gentle wriggle around the third or fourth vertebrae became a mighty sway at the sixtieth or seventieth vertebrae and at the tail an almighty lash which swished back and forth the width of Swanston Street. So we never stopped running from one side of the street to the other. 

No, running is not the right word — we had to sprint like hell.
