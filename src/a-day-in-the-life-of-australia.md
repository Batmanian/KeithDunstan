<p class="lead">Commissioned by 'The Age' newspaper to celebrate Australia's bicentennial in 1998, Keith wrote an historical account of Australia's history for each day of the year. They were compiled to form this book. Published in 1989.
</p>
<p>From the original cover: "These are just some of the stirring events that made the news over the past two hundred years. Day by day, Keith Dunstan recreated sensational stories from our history in his 1988 Age column. Now, in response to public demand, they have been collected in one handsome and memorable volume.</p>
<p>
A Day in the Life of Australia offers a fascinating series of glimpses into an Australia that is gone for ever —a brilliant kaleidoscope of great moments as they would have appeared to those alive at the time. Contemporary illustrations add a lively and authentic touch. 
Amazing, appalling, entertaining and informative, the news of yesteryear makes great reading today. </p>

            Creighton Burns, Editor of the Age in Melbourne, had the original idea. He said: `Why not celebrate Australia's Bicentenary this way? Take events that you find interesting, then go through the diary day by day in 1988 and match them with the same day in some year during the previous two hundred. 
            </p><p>
            'Just move at random, one day 1802, the next 1888 or 1938. You could even come as close as 1975, but keep out of immediate memory, like four or five years ago. 
            </p><p>
            'But don't' he continued 'just dully record what happened. Go back, say, in an H.G. Wells Time Machine, and carry on as if you were actually alive and kicking at the time. Wherever you can, use contemporary sources.'</p><p> So that is what we did. I had the help of Colin Dawson, a former librarian at the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, a man who had the reputation that when given a clue he could find anything, and find he did. He did much of the incredible research, making particular use of the marvellous collection of newspapers and journals at Melbourne's La Trobe Library. I tried to stick to the rules, not to get out of the time warp and make use of tempting events that took place perhaps a week or years after-wards. There were traps, because often information was withheld, censored or unknown right on the date. For example, I got into trouble over the World War 2 raids on Darwin. The Australian public at the time was innocent of what really happened. I stuck faithfully to the mood and message of the day. Here and there I have added a 'Note' to give further information. </p><p>Creighton Burns said: 'We will run it for a month or so to see if anyone finds it interesting'. Well, many did, so it ran for the whole year in many newspapers around Australia. We were overwhelmed with correspondence, particularly from grandchildren and great-grandchildren of people mentioned.</p><p> There were letters from schools, signed by every class member; letters from all sorts of amateur historians. Invariably they said: 'We are pasting your daily series into a scrapbook but we have lost February 23 and August 18, so it is not complete. You do intend to bring it out as a book at the end of the year don't you?' In answer to those questions, here it is.

        Keith Dunstan, 1989.
