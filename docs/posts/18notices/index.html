<p>(b)	If an address has not been nominated under Rule 18.2(a), service may be effected:</p>
<p>(i)	by posting the notice to the last known address of the Lot Owner; or</p>
<p>(ii)	if an address under paragraph (a) is not known or if a notice sent to that address is returned, in any other manner the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal considers appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="183advice-to-occupiers">18.3	Advice to Occupiers</h2>
<p>A Lot Owner who does not occupy its Lot must give the Occupier of the Lot a copy of the Rules of the Owners Corporation and associated annexures at the commencement of occupation.</p>

An Occupier of a Lot:</p>

<p>(c)	to accept a certificate signed by the Secretary of the Owners Corporation as prima facie proof of the costs and expenses incurred by the Owners Corporation to rectify the Lot Owner&rsquo;s and Occupier&rsquo;s non-compliance with the Rules;</p>
<p>(d)	to pay interest at the rate prescribed by the Owners Corporation on all monies outstanding under these Rules (including the non-payment of any Owners Corporation fees) until they are paid; and</p>
<p>(e)	that any payments made for the purposes of these Rules will be appropriated first in payment of any interest and any unpaid costs and expenses of the Owners Corporation and then be applied in repayment of the principal sum.</p>
<h2 id="186recovery-of-costs">18.6	Recovery of Costs</h2>
<p>(a)	A Lot Owner and Occupier must pay on demand the whole of the Owners Corporation&rsquo;s costs and expenses (including solicitor and own client costs and Owners Corporation management fees, plus any GST properly chargeable in respect of these costs) in connection with:</p>

<p>(b)	The amount of any such costs will be deemed to be a liquidated debt due by the Lot Owner or Occupier to the Owners Corporation.</p>
<p>(c)	If the Lot Owner or Occupier fails to pay such costs upon demand, the Owners Corporation:</p>
<p>(i)	may take action for the recovery of those costs in a court of competent jurisdiction, and/or;</p>
<p>(ii)	may enter such costs and expenses against the levy account of the Lot Owner.</p>
<p>(d)	The Owners Corporation may include any costs payable to it under this Rule on any certificate issued in respect of the Lot pursuant to the Act, including but not limited to a notation of unpaid insurance premiums.</p>
<h2 id="187recovery-of-expenditure">18.7	Recovery of Expenditure</h2>
<p>Where the Owners Corporation expends money to make good the damage caused by a breach of the Act or of these Rules by a Lot Owner or Occupier or an invitee of either of them, the Owners Corporation will be entitled to recover the amount so expended as a debt in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction from the Lot Owner or Occupier at the time when the breach occurred</p>
