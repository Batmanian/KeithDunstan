<p>perhaps four or five years. So they have been able to look at the town
v an outsider. Then nobody knows a town like a bank manager,
except, of course, the clergy and they won't talk anyway.</p>
<p>Communications, too, can be a worry. The column has gone by
ship's radio, by radio from aircraft, by pedal wireless, by messenger,
by teleprinter, by telegram and I am still looking for the day when
it will be possible to put it in a bottle and drop it over the side of a
hot,</p>
<p>One of the earliest columns on the move was a visit to Washing-
ton, where after much pleading with the U.S. Air Force they agreed
to {ly me to Fort Worth, Texas, and show me the bombers of
SMrategic Air Command. First I was put through a most careful
security check. References had to come from the Embassy. No I
wasn't, nor had I ever been in the U.S.S.R., Red China or behind the
Iron Curtain. I even wondered if it would improve my chances if I
pointed out that I was a Liberal voter of ten years standing and a
tlevoted supporter of Robert Gordon Menzies. |</p>
<p>iventually, checked, cross-examined, security-cleared, with a
bundle of permits, I was ready to go.</p>
<p>I took off in a dear old vintage DC3, the property of the U.S.A.A.F.
und I was just a little surprised that they still had one in service. It
had no luxuries, nothing but the hard, cruel, bottom-deadening steel
benches down the sides as used in World War Two. -</p>
<p>The passengers were a curious mixture: G.Ls, sailors, and maybe a
dozen of the U.S. Women’s Army Corps, one of whom was a major.
| was the only passenger in civilian clothes and must have been
considered a remarkably important V.IP. The aircraft’s destination
wis San Antonio, Texas, but the instructions were that it could
land at the S.A.C,, Carswell Air Base, Fort Worth, but I would be
the only person permitted to leave the aircraft.</p>
<p>You must appreciate that this was a very long flight in an elderly
neroplane. It was designed for an era when it was really unnecessary
to provide fancy lavatory facilities. We became more and more
strained and tense as we approached the Texas border. There was
sulfering on all faces, both male and female.</p>
<p>At last we landed at Carswell Air Base, the door of the DC3
opened and we all rushed out. But wait — two jeeps were there with
Browning ‘50 calibre machine guns on the back.</p>
<p>I was the only one with a permit, hence I was the only one allowed to proceed. The pilot and co-pilot had permission to walk</p>
<p>~ to the control tower to complete their flight plan, that’s all — the
others were not allowed to move more than twenty feet from the
DC3. Then to make sure that they did not, the jeep covered them
with the Browning machine guns.</p>
<p>&quot;The W.A.C. major could only be described as livid. She protested,
she complained and one time she even mentioned that she would
call on the President of the United States, but it made no difference.
Had they been all boys, or all girls maybe they would have been
tempted to ease their problems behind the under-carriage some-
where, but they did not. The plant was re-fuelled and off they went,
on to San Antonio. I often wondered how they got on.</p>
<p>As for me, I was taken on a guided tour and it was pointed out
very bluntly that I would be allowed in no operational building, nor
would I be allowed inside any aircraft. It was a great privilege for
a foreigner to be allowed on the base at all.</p>
<p>Carswell was just one of a great string of S.A.C. bases in a semi-
circle around the lower half of the U.S. From here bombers could fly
direct to attack such cities as Moscow, Leningrad, Kuibyshev, Khar-
kov, or Kiev, then maybe finish their runs at bases in England, the
Middle East or the Pacific. |</p>
<p>I noticed that pilots, aircrew, groundstaff, all carried Colt -45s or
carbines; helmets and gas masks were at their sides. One squadron
was always at the ready, other aircrews were under instruction never
to go more than one hour’s driving time from the base.</p>
<p>| There was an atmosphere of war and real business, utterly differ-</p>
<p>ent from anywhere else. All around the base and off into the distance</p>
<p>~ were the great shapes of the B36 bombers and it had to be presumed</p>
<ul>
<li>that many of them were already loaded with nuclear weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked formally to see over a B36 and permission was formally re-
fused. I could walk around one under escort, that was all. The escort
was a jeep with a *50 calibre machine gun on the back once again. The
B36, now outdated, was a very big aeroplane. Somehow they were
like a praying mantis, all out of proportion. Their nose was too long,
their tail too high, and it was not easy to tell which way they were
heading. Their wings hung down slightly as if it were too great a
strain to support the weight of their ten engines. When they started
up in the morning the six 3,500 horsepower propeller engines shook
the buildings way off in Fort Worth; when the other four jets</p>
<p>~ came in with their treble shriek the combination was terrifying.
So I had my walk slowly around a B36 nucear bomber and as I
~ walked the jeep followed in first gear. When I paused the jeep</p>
<ul>
<li>paused and all the time a negro corporal had his Browning trained
straight at me. One appreciated this enthusiasm for the security of</li>
<li>United States war weapons, but it was quite difficult to concentrate
on the matter in hand. Indeed when another DC3 took me back to
Washington the next day I had difficulty in trying to remember what</li>
</ul>
<p>a B36 looked like. But, nevertheless, ‘it made a column’. ‘</p>
<p>After this I was in favour with the US.A.AF. I mean, a week
went by and no vital secrets about S.A.C. and the B36 leaked out to
the U.S.S.R. No longer was I such a security risk, so they took me
~down to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and offered me a ride
in a Lockheed F94 night fighter. |</p>
<ul>
<li>The F94s were in charge of U.S. defences on the Atlantic seaboard,
they could get to 40,000 feet in a matter of minutes and they were
loaded with very sophisticated radar equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>My pilot was Lieutenant Ernest Harley who had run up 100 or
so combat missions on jets in Korea. He gave me a flying suit,</p>
<ul>
<li>helmet, oxygen mask, Mae West, parachute, then strapped me down
so securely in the rear seat that I couldn’t move. I think he was rather
frightened that I might try to escape. |</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Now don’t touch anything, get me, not anything. And particu-
larly don’t touch that red knob unless I tell you to. That’s the ejector
seat. If you touch that you'll get an almighty kick in the backside
which will send you seventy feet into the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Get 1t |</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Oh yes, I get it.’</p>
<p>I was taken as a passenger because Lieutenant Harley’s plane had
to tow a drogue so that the rest of the squadron could have target
practice at sea off Atlantic City. | |</p>
<p>This in itself was an awe-inspiring experience. The other aircraft
would make passes at us by turn. They would peel off, perhaps 3,000
feet above, dive down at 600 m.p.h. then open fire on the target</p>
<ul>
<li>drogue trailing behind us by steel cable. As they screamed down it
was difficult to get rid of the idea that they were not diving and
shooting straight at us. As they dived away and climbed up for
another pass there was always the joy of still being alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>We flew back to McGuire Base, dropped the drogue from the air,</p>
<p>und Licutenant Harley said: ‘Say, we got a bit of gas left; would you
like me to throw her around a bit?’</p>
<p>'Oh yes, please do,’ I said, ‘I've had a lot of experience of that sort
of thing.’ ,</p>
<p>It was one of those brave remarks that one regrets even before they
are out. My experience had been long before, training on Tiger
Moths and Wirraways. I hadn’t quite realized how aeroplanes had
come on since then. ~ |</p>
<p>I le started with a series of continuous slow rolls, then a barrel
roll, then a loop, then a loop with a roll off the top. I sat in the back
(quite numb. He had only to go round a bend, the blood drained out
of my face and everything went grey.</p>
<p>‘You there, everything O.K.?’ he shouted over the intercom, ‘let’s
do something interesting.” Before I had a chance to reply he climbed
to 20,000 feet, rolled the F94 on its back and went straight down.
At almost ground level he pulled out of the dive. Eyes, face,
somach, everything flattened down and I couldn’t even raise
an arm. My head seemed to sink right down into my shoulder
blades and all went utterly black. Shooting along close to the speed
of sound, he let in the after burner, a device which pours fuel into
the jet stream and vastly increases the power. He pulled back the
sick and the F94 went straight up like a rocket back to 20,000 with
the altimeter spinning like a propeller.</p>
<p>‘Man I'm sorry that I can’t give you more. If we don’t go back
we'll be out of juice.’</p>
<p>‘O, please don’t apologize,’ I replied, ‘it’s quite all right, really.’</p>
<p>After we landed he took one look. ‘Gee, I'm sorry; are you all
right?’ ,,
After that it seemed wise to abandon the U.S.A.AF. and keep to in-
augural flights on airlines. The grandest inaugural I remember was
the flight across the North Pole by Canadian Pacific Airlines. We
flew from Sydney to Hawaii to Vancouver to Sondrestrom, Green-
land to Amsterdam. This flight is remembered with such love
because we had aboard the top columnists of the U.S. and Canada,
leading Mayors, including Alderman Hills, Mayor of Sydney, and
the president of Canadian Pacific. When one has the president of the
Airline aboard it gives one just that little extra confidence in opera-
tions,</p>
<p>‘ Never was a tour laid on with such luxury. The transcontinental
flight finishedat Amsterdam, but CP.R. laid on feeder flights to
London and Paris. At every city large black Cadillacs were at our
disposal. Always a line of Cadillacs was at the hotel front door and
if one wanted to drive to Les Halles for a feed of snails or to
Versailles to see the spot where Marie Antoinette stood for the last
time before they took her away, one had only to signal. Beautiful
Cadillacs they were, all with push-button electric windows.</p>
<p>Only the very best hotels were chosen, like the Royal Hawaiian in
Honolulu, the George Cinq in Paris or the Savoy in London.
Curiously enough the Savoy was voted the best hotel by the Ameri-
can columnists. I think it gained the edge because of its somewhat</p>
<p>titanic plumbing and always there was a telephone right beside the
toilet, a refinement unthought of even in the United States.</p>
<p>The most spectacular sections of the journeys were, of course,
between Vancouver and Amsterdam. The only stop between the
two was at Sondrestrom in Greenland. This piece of Danish territory
was pretty much like the last place on earth. To approach the strip
we had to come right down into an icy fjord. Look out the left
window and there was sheer rock; look out the right window and
there was sheer rock. All the passengers were a little unnerved,
until one of the Australians down aft went into action.</p>
<p>Not so long ago every Australian country town had a sign for
Rexona soap on the road leading in and the road leading out. It read,
say, WELCOME TO BIRRUMGUMBI — ANOTHER GOOD REXONA TOWN.</p>
<p>Just at that frightening moment when were approaching this
Arctic airport, an Australian voice called out, ‘WELCOME To sOND-
RESTROM — ANOTHER GOOD REXONA TOWN.’</p>
<p>Sondrestrom was actually a U.S. leased base. We were taken by car
to the refreshment room. We were not allowed to walk about and
we were not allowed to take photographs. To the north of Sondres-
trom was the legendary U.S. base Thule, which reportedly had cost
$350 million. Here the Americans had interceptor squadrons which
operated in heated hangars. Both ends of the hangars would open
and the jets could fly to the attack in ninety-four seconds.</p>
<p>At Thule the ground was frozen to a depth of 1,000 feet and we
were told that the troops had every possible luxury except women
and modern sewerage arrangements. The lack of women was not</p>
<p>80 casy to explain, but the other item was impossible because of the
lack of water and bad ground.</p>
<p>We flew north from Sondrestrom out over the great ice cap of
Greenland, over immense glaciers where the ice in places was 8,000
feet deep. Then further and further north we went across endless
tracts of ice until just before midnight, when the sun had sunk to a
red ball on the summer horizon and the whole icy scene was covered
with a soft glow of pink.</p>
<p>It was then that we began to feel very much like rugged explorers.
Alter all, we had consumed filet de boeuf, Chateau Lafite, Mumms
champagne Brut, Russia caviar, and we were on the cognac and
cigars. Cabin temperature could have been described as slightly
cxcessive, at seventy-five degrees. Someone had the smart idea, why
not send a cable to the Australians on Mawson in the Antarctic and
we worded it:</p>
<p>WE THE MOST NORTHERN AUSTRALIANS ON INAUGURAL FLIGHT ACROSS
TIIE NORTH POLE SEND GREETINGS TO YOU THE MOST SOUTHERN AUSTRA-
LIANS, and it was signed by Alderman Hills, the Lord Mayor of
Sydney. |</p>
<p>Several days later in London we daring explorers received the
reply from the Antarctic: —</p>
<p>GREETINGS HEARTILY RECIPROCATED GRATEFUL YOUR REMEMBERING US</p>
<p>AT MAWSON ANTARCTIC FROM JOHN BECHERVAISE.
Quite the most rewarding country for writing columns was Japan,
and at Christmas 1963 I went there with Barry Woodhouse, a T.V.
cameraman. Until then always I had worked on the premise that
enlightened foreigners spoke English.</p>
<p>Indeed, this idea works amazingly well until one arrives in Japan.
Outside Tokyo, curiously enough, the Japanese speak almost entirely
in Japanese. Barry and I discovered this at Hiroshima airport. As
comes to all men, we needed to find a lavatory. There was no point
in asking any of the airline officials; they did not speak English.
We looked for signs —even Hommes and Femmes or Signors and
Signoras would have been good enough. But they did not have these
cither, only places with Japanese characters above.</p>
<p>Barry had the right idea. He suggested we pick a place where a
lot of men were coming in and out in rapid succession. This was a very good scheme and it worked amazingly well, except that what
we saw inside was rather alarming. Later our Tokyo correspondent
explained it all to our satisfaction. How naive we were to expect that
in Japan there would be separate toilets for men and women. That</p>
<ul>
<li>sort of thing was provided only at fancy hotels to soothe the strange
foreigners. |
| Of course, this was only the beginning of our problems. We had
vast difficulty in catching trains, reading platform numbers and,
worst of all, trying to discover which station was which.
The night we were travelling from Osaka to Tokyo was interest-
ing. We were flying by an an.a. Lockheed Electra. This a.N.A. was
~ not to be confused with any other a.N.a.— Mr Ansett had made no
take-over bids. a.N.a. stood for All Nippon Airlines. Nobody could
~ explain to us in English how we should catch this aircraft but, as I</li>
<li>said to Barry, it was perfectly simple. It was most unlikely that any
other aircraft would be departing at 6.30 p.m. All we had to do was
to wait until somebody announced things in Japanese, then board
the nearest A.N.A. aircraft.
This we did. Seats in the Electra were on a first-come-first-served
basis, so we sat down front. The aircraft taxied off, warmed up at
~ the end of the runway. Then suddenly there was much talk down
aft. Maybe the air hostess discovered she had more than the expected
number of passengers. Anyway a small man came running up, and
‘with great courtesy, said: ‘Please, I think your ticket says you are
going to Tokyo. Very, very sorry, sir. This aeroplane is going to
Hokkaido.’ |
So we had to start all over again, lining up in queues and next
~ time we managed to find the right aircraft. Dinner, of course, was
served aboard, and no doubt other airline operators would have been
interested in the catering. It was simplicity itself. The air hostess,
~ very pretty, very Japanese, gave each of us a carton. We opened our
cartons and inside was a piece of bamboo with two ridiculously
short chop sticks and a plastic bubble of soya sauce. Inside the
bamboo was a mess of cold rice and raw fish. It can be awkward
coping with rice and chop sticks even in the comfort of a Chinese
restaurant, but when one is in a bumpy aircraft it’s like trying to
push camels through needles. It was a situation where a visiting</li>
<li>Australian could not afford to lose face, but finding my face was
~difficult and most of the rice and raw fish landed on my trousers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were other occasions when one badly felt the need for a
knowledge of Japanese. In Hiroshima a pipe smoker was something
of a curiosity. Very few Japanese smoke pipes, so I was followed by
Japanese children down the street. They would point and giggle. It
was bad enough trying to buy pipe tobacco in such a town, but can
you imagine the problem of getting pipe cleaners? Naturally, first
I tried the most touristy place in town, the Hiroshima Grand Hotel.
The girl in the shop there did appear to speak English. I asked for
pipe cleaners. She looked blank. - ‘</p>
<p>I held up my pipe and my last pipe cleaner and then went into an
claborate explanation as to what it did.</p>
<p>She smiled: ‘Clean pipe. Ah, of course.’</p>
<p>I smiled, too. At last we were getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Whereupon she took my pipe, put it under a tap and started to
clean it with a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Actually the fellow to watch in Japan is the one who believes he
understands English. I was shown over the Olympic Games venues
by a gentleman from the Public Relations Department. He was most
amiable. To every question I asked he replied: ‘Yes.” ‘Will you have
French, Italian, Greek, and Russian interpreters?’ — Yes. ‘Will you
have different cooking for all the various nationalities?’ — Yes. ‘Will
the Emperor attend all events?’— Yes. &quot; ’/</p>
<p>Finally, I became suspicious and said: ‘Is it true that Japan has
invited 5,200,000 overseas newspapermen to the Games?’ ,</p>
<p>He beamed and said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Fortunately a great deal of trouble and embarrassment was saved
by meeting Peter Temm. Peter, a New Zealander and a freelance
correspondent, could read, write and speak fluent Japanese. He was
married to a Japanese girl and at home lived Japanese style.</p>
<p>Peter gave me the opportunity to watch Japanese T.V. and I
became a devoted fan of Japanese war films. They were on every
night and I presumed that here, very smartly, I would see the entire
destruction of the U.S. Navy. But no, they stuck to historical facts.
The Japanese servicemen were always immensely brave, doing heroic
things against overwhelming odds. The film always ended in deep
tragedy, grim music, servicemen being blown up, machine gunned,
sunk. Apparently it was all most satisfying. | -</p>
<p>Then one had to admire the brilliance of the Japanese dubbing of
voices. The Japanese Ben Casey was so perfectly matched it was</p>
<p>almost uncanny. His dubbed voice was equally truculent and un-
bearable. Doctor Kildare again had the same purity of innocence.
Lucille Ball had the same air raid siren quality and the Japanese
Matt Dillon was kinda slow, kinda laconic.</p>
<p>It was explained to me that they went even further than this.
Say the character in the movie was a real, slick New Yorker. Then
he had a slick Tokyo accent. Say he was a Southerner, then he had
a southern Kyushu accent. On the other hand, if he was a pidgin-
talking native in a Tarzan film, ‘Me M’Bongo, plenty bad native —
want kill’. Well, they put that into a sort of pidgin Korean. This
suited because there was little love lost between Japanese and
Koreans. The only trouble was it took twice as long to say anything
in Japanese and the unfortunate Japanese Matt Dillons and Ben
Caseys had to go like the devil to get through their speeches in time.</p>
<p>Yet television was nothing. Peter Temm insisted that if I wanted a
column about the real Japan then it was essential that I should go
to a bath house. Actually I had already been to a bath house and I
remembered the experience with great pleasure. There was a private
room, a hot box, a Japanese flower arrangement, shaving gear, per-
fumed ointments and such, all supplied. The grand climax came as
I stretched face down on the massage table . . . the famous walking
treatment.</p>
<p>The masseuse stood on the insteps of my feet, then with the
‘balance of a tight-rope walker, walked up the backs of my legs, then
on to my spine. It wasn’t any namby pamby stuff, either. As she
promenaded she sank in her toes, pushing back any discs that might
have slipped lately. The effect was sensational and one couldn’t help
but think it was high time that our own women learned to walk
on our spines. Except, of course, it is wise to have a well-dieted
walker. This one was, maybe, nine stone.</p>
<p>‘How much did it all cost you?’ asked Peter Temm.</p>
<p>I told him that it was reasonably cheap, around $1.75.</p>
<p>He was contemptuous. “That’s the nonsense that they turn on for
the tourists. How about going to a real Japanese bath house, the sort</p>
<p>‘they use themselves? I can tell you it won’t cost $1.75. You'll get out
of it for about five cents.’ |</p>
<p>‘Will they let me in?’ |</p>
<p>Td better go with you,’” he said. “They mightn’t appreciate the
invasion of foreigners and it’s best to have someone around who
speaks Japanese.” |</p>
<p>So we went down the street and Peter explained that this was part
of the life. Not many of the houses had their own bathrooms and
there was a public bath house on every street corner. The Japanese
were probably the cleanest people in the world.</p>
<p>Our bath house was typical, very pretty with upturned eaves, so
that it looked like a temple. Outside was the traditional bath house
sign, as famous as the striped barber’s pole in the West. It was a
Neon light and it had vertical wavy lines, symbolizing the rising
of steam.</p>
<p>We paid twenty-eight yen each at the door, a bored looking girl
told us to take off our clothes and indicated a place to put them in a
locker. There was a partition down the centre, men on the right and
women on the left. The bored looking girl had a seat up aloft so
that she could observe both naked males and females.</p>
<p>We went into a tiled room and sat down on stools in front of
buckets of water. Other bathers, Japanese men with almost shaved
heads were looking at us with undisguised curiosity. “What are
foreigners doing in our bath?’ I felt distinctly out of place.</p>
<p>‘Just carry on as if you do this every day,” said Peter. “What you
have to do now is scrub yourself all over until it hurts. You've got to
get yourself clean, really clean and when you’ve done that you must
get rid of every trace of soap. This is so that when you get into the
public bath with everyone else — you’re perfectly clean.’</p>
<p>So I scrubbed and washed all over and a rather charming part of
the service was the fact that a muscular Japanese with a big scrub-
bing brush came over and did my back.</p>
<p>When we had gained the right degree of purity Peter Temm
indicated the public bath. It had raised edges about two feet six inches
high and it was the size of a small swimming pool. However, much
care had been taken to make it pleasing to the eye. It was very
pretty with a Japanese garden grotto in the corner. Already a dozen
men were sitting in the bath, water up to their necks. |</p>
<p>Peter said this type of separate bathing was a new trend in Japan.
Outside of Tokyo the sexes still mixed in together. Shortly after he
married he went for a public bath at Beppu. To his profound
astonishment he found himself sitting in the water next to his mother-in-law. ‘Of course she wasn’t embarrassed, but it startled
me,’ he said. ’</p>
<p>You have no idea of the heat of that water. As we stepped into
the bath it seemed hotter than anything I had ever experienced. We
crouched with the water around our necks and the heat seemed to
well up in volumes, so that one’s face became the colour of a stop
light. It was important to remain utterly still; any waves and the
rest of one’s neck would be scalded.</p>
<p>After five minutes normal consciousness began to return and it
was possible to look around at our bath mates. Frankly, they were a
pretty rugged, fierce-looking bunch, the type you wouldn’t want to
meet on the Kokoda Trail. Almost every one of them had tattoos
on their arms and bodies, not hearts with arrows through or any-
thing like that, but Japanese characters.</p>
<p>Peter said these tattoos were like badges. They indicated that the
gentlemen concerned belonged to various gangster gangs in Tokyo.
The marks were a sign of manliness. Some, also, had incredible
scars on their backs. Stabbings, razor slashings, I thought. |</p>
<p>But Peter was unworried. He knew a great deal about his subject
and talked on. Guns were hard to get in Tokyo, he said, so there
was a novel type of fighting. Often rival gangster groups fought it
out with Samurai swords. What’s more, even swords, like pistols,
had to be officially registered.</p>
<p>There was a special code. If a gangster failed in a mission he |
suffered fearful loss of face. Often he could restore his position only
by cutting off a finger and delivering it to his gang leader. Although
he felt that gangsters were softening up considerably. He was.
ashamed to say that many of them now went to the hospital and
had their gift finger cut off under anaesthetic. |</p>
<p>As he spoke I became more and more nervous. I looked around.
These fellows had all their fingers. Obviously they were highly
efficient gangsters. We were the only non-Japanese in the place. How
easy it would be to carve us up and take our wallets. Nobody had
been advised that we were here. We would simply disappear for
ever, without trace. '</p>
<p>‘Let’s get out of here,’ I said. We dried ourselves, went to our
lockers and quickly dressed. We hurried out the door, but not
quickly enough —a man came running. He took Peter Temm aside
and talked excitedly to him.</p>
<p>You see, Peter had left his watch behind in one of the lockers
and this man was making sure that Peter got it back:</p>
<p>The man was one of the gangsters.</p>
<p>Some of the columns were far from light-hearted and in this category
I put the visit to Kure and the visit to Saigon. Kure could be
described as the Portsmouth of Japan. It was the traditional centre
for the Navy and for shipbuilding. Immediately after the war it
was home for the Australians and the British Commonwealth Occu-
pational Forces. |</p>
<p>Of course, when the war ended and the Japanese Navy ceased to
exist, Kure lost its main industry and it became a poverty-stricken,
tragic place. We don’t know precisely the number of illegitimate
children left behind in Japan by the Australian occupation forces.
It happens wherever soldiers go to fight, in every garrison city.
HoweWthered all the publicity and it became special
because of the wretched conditions in which the half-Australians</p>
<p>~ lived. §t became even more special because of colour prejudice. It
comes as a shock when prejudice works the other way.</p>
<p>The man who had done most to spread the word was Mr Alex
Ferguson who had an electrical business in Melbourne. After a trip
to Japan he was so shocked by the sight of the Kure waifs he decided
to devote the rest of his life to helping them. He appeared repeatedly
on television and radio, he pleaded with all the newspapers, and he
was just in the process of calling rallies in the Melbourne and Sydney
Town Halls when he died.</p>
<p>Before I went to Kure there was still a good deal of scepticism
about the waifs. One Australian resident in Japan even suggested
that the whole thing was a sweet little racket. No more than half a
dozen of them had ever appeared in public at the one time. He said:
‘Do me a favour, will you? Demand to see all the records, all the
case histories and count every one of those orphans, physically.” It
seemed a pretty tall order. For one thing I had no Japanese and how
could I ever tell the waifs from other Japanese children.</p>
<p>At Hiroshima Airport I was met by Miss Yone Ito, the local
representative of International Social Service. She had cared for the
Australian waifs during the past three years and Mr Ferguson had
called her “The Angel of Kure’.</p>
<p>At first I did not know what to make of Miss Ito. At thirty-threeshe was quite a good-looking woman and a graduate social worker
from Louisville University, Kentucky. She was infinitely courteous</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>and considerate, but never warm. Always on her bland face there
was this half smile, but never a whole smile. .
She told of the last visit by Mr Ferguson, how even then he knew
‘that he had not long to live. She said that when staying at the
Hiroshima Grand Hotel he had heart attack after heart attack. He
ran out of his special pills and even had to borrow some from an
~ American. Yet he insisted on coming to Kure to see the waifs. |
Miss Ito had no car, so we used taxis and went to Kure by train.
She talked quite frankly about the waifs. At school they were called</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘specials’ or Nisei (mixed bloods) or even ‘Gaijin’ (foreigner). Being</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>~a Nisei at a Japanese school was not easy to live down. Children</p>
<ul>
<li>would not usually forgive that sort of thing. It went much deeper
than that. They knew these children were even more different. They
had no respectable ancestors, they could not account for their father;
a matter for great shame in Japan. Miss Ito was utterly correct in
everything she said. She never commented, she never condemned.
&quot;The only time she came close to censure was when asked if she ever
heard from the parents. That half smile almost disappeared. ‘Only
one,” she said. ‘He came to Japan, visited his daughter and her
mother. They prayed together. But the father could not do anything.
He received only a pension in Australia.’ |</li>
</ul>
<p>~ Then another time a cheque came from one of the fathers. He
lived in northern New South Wales and he regretted it was quite
impossible for him to reveal his name. There was only one flaw in
his reasoning. The cheque was signed with his name and drawn on
the local trading bank. N |</p>
<p>We went to Miss Ito’s little office and here I did get a chance to
inspect the records, all as clear as could be, and all in English. She
had been caring for ninety-two orphans of mixed parentage around
Kure and of these at least fifty-two had Australian servicemen for
fathers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So we started the rounds of the schools to visit the waifs one by
one. There was no point in expecting them to be little Australians.
They had been brought up as Japanese, spoke very little English and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the boys wore those ugly, black, military school uniforms. They
clipped right up to the neck, completely unornamented like school
cadet uniforms of the 1930s. Yet it was obvious that the children
were almost Australian. One could pick them immediately in every
class. Miss Ito did not have to say a word. They were taller, their
skin was paler, their hait not jet black and they were ‘wide-eyed.
There was one little kid I will never forget, Yoshio Shimizu, aged
twelve. He was a real little devil, into more trouble than Ginger
Meggs. His face was covered in freckles. Freckles in Japan are
extraordinary, an object of real curiosity. |</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At one high school we met Masaaki Usui, aged sixteen. His
father was in the AJLF. His mother worked as a waitress in a Hiro-
shima hotel for $20 a month. She saw Masaaki only once a month
and she paid $16/ out of her wages to keep him at high school.
Masaaki lived in two rooms with his grandmother, who took in
needlework. Their biggest luxury was electric light, their water
came from a communal tap. -</p>
<p>When we arrived at the high school Masaaki was pounding the
track in a green track suit. He had the leanness, the style and stride
off Herb Elliott written all over him. His coach Nobuhisa Mitsuta
said early on he had been branded as a Nisei, but Masaaki had been
such a phenomenal success all this had been forgiven. Masaaki
startled the Hiroshima High School by making the track team for
800 metres and 1500 metres in his first year and now he had been
chosen to go to Okinawa for an international meeting between
American, Okinawa and Japanese High Schools.</p>
<p>Mitsuta asked if I knew Percy Cerutty. He said they were both
carefully following Cerutty’s training methods. It was Masaaki’s
dream to become another Herb Elliott and the way he was shaping
he had a very good chance. Before we left there was a gathering of
the teachers and with tremendous courtesy and much bowing we
were presented with exquisite ashtrays made by students of the
school as a memento of our visit. B | ~</p>
<p>We went on. We met Yumiko Hori, sixteen, who was training as
a hairdresser in a beauty school at Iwakuni. This girl was beautiful,
soft brown hair and big brown eyes. All her expenses were being
paid by International Social Service. Her mother was very poor; she
worked in a Hiroshima bar. Miss Ito said that Yumiko knew only
one thing — her father’s surname. It was her plan to visit Australia
to find him.</p>
<p>When this happens one can only hope that Yumiko gives her
father a little advanced warning. She could create a small sensation if ‘she knocked at the front door-one morning and said: ‘I'm here to</p>
<ul>
<li>see Dad.’ -</li>
</ul>
<p>At a primary school we met Karumi, aged nine, one of the</p>
<ul>
<li>youngest of the Australians. She was extremely shy and terrified of
being photographed. She was so tall that her teacher had to put her
in the back seat of the class. Life was hard for Karumi. Her mother
married a Japanese and the man refused to suffer the shame of
having her in the house. Karumi had never seen where her mother
lived. Her mother’s visits were extremely rare. So she lived alone
with her great-grandmother who was deaf, over eighty and senile.
Their room with its peeling paper walls was utterly wretched and</li>
</ul>
<p>~ they lived on public assistance from the Kure Welfare Department.</p>
<p>We went on and on and I made it clear to Miss Ito that I wanted
to see all the children and by the time I had done so I had a great
feeling of guilt for having been so insistent. She was indeed the
Angel of Kure. But as it turned out, the task of seeing the last of
the children was not so difficult. An Australian warship was visiting
Kure and the sailors gave them a mighty Christmas party. The ship
was decorated with balloons and streamers. The cooks turned on
cakes, sandwiches, ice cream, jam tarts. There were little kids swing-
ing on the guns, working the pom poms and sailors dressed as
clowns and pirates even walked the plank into the icy water. I have
rarely seen children laugh so much. .</p>
<p>As we left the ship and returned to the wharf we noticed some
taxis lined up. Inside were Japanese prostitutes and the Japanese
madam was walking up and down the wharf, rounding up Austra-
lian sailors and putting them in the cabs with the girls.</p>
<p>Miss Ito said nothing and we said nothing, but there was real
irony in the situation. If we had taken a photograph of the boys, the
girls and the tough-looking madam the caption could have been:
“This is where we came in.’</p>
<ul>
<li>Soon afterwards Miss Ito flew to Australia on a fund-raising
campaign. Much money was needed because education was ex-
tremely competitive in Japan. It was vital that the Kure waifs should
have above-average education to help them overcome their Nisei-
shame. They needed to go to universities. At Kure Miss Ito said she
wanted £100,000 ($200,000) and she picked out two of the Kure
waifs. She showed me the two she had in mind. Beautiful children
they were, and the temptation for anyone would have been to adopt
them at once. _/ | : 4.
Miss Ito arrived in Melbourne, terribly ill after a bumpy flight
from Sydney. For the first time I saw her in Japanese dress, not just</li>
<li>the ordinary kimono, but the formal homongi of heavy silk complete
~ with obi. Nothing could have been worse than having to face a
formal reception. Not only did she feel ill but for the first time in
many a year, she had to wear this strange restricting dress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, she did not bring the children with her. International Social
Service did not approve. It felt that the travel, the subjection to all
kinds of publicity would not be good for them. Others did not agree
and there is no doubt that Australian immigration restrictions would
eventually have been overcome for the adoption of the children in
Australia. |</p>
<p>Miss Ito did not say much, but she was disappointed at the
decision. It was like taking away the six-guns from a cowboy. She
was bereft of firepower. The children would have been a sensation
on every television programme. By herself Miss Ito did not have
the personality or appeal to put it over. | |</p>
<ul>
<li>So the campaign all around Australia was not the success it could
have been. The final result was £21,600 ($43,200) and with donations
from the Federal Government there has been just enough money
for the waifs of Kure to get by. |
Saigon was also a good city for columns, but not the light-hearted
variety. The premier Ngo Dinh Diem had just been murdered and
all was in a state of chaos. |</li>
<li>This. was my first visit since 1945 and outwardly there had been
little change. Saigon still looked a lovely piece of provincial France,
the tree-lined boulevards, the exquisite little squares and the side-
walk cafés with their superb French cuisine were as before. It was
the only city in all Asia where one could buy a cheap bottle of good
wine. The dark-haired Vietnamese girls, as slender as lilies, were
still the world’s most beautiful. Everywhere they rode bicycles and
one pondered what a miracle it was that the long panels of their
national dress did not catch in the spokes. -</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1945 it was a war city. There was a military ruling that no
person was to go beyond the city limits and it was unsafe to venture a
nywhere after dark without sidearms. Nearly nine years later it
was still forbidden to go beyond the city limits and still unsafe after
dark.</p>
<ul>
<li>But there were some changes. For the traveller there was now a
somewhat luxurious hotel, the Caravelle. American troops had
replaced French troops. Furthermore it had become the custom to
sell postcards by the side of the footpath. Postcards? On close inspec-</li>
</ul>
<p>~tion one discovered that these were not send-home pictures of
charming Saigon scenes, they were colour pictures of Buddhist
priests incinerating themselves with petrol. Some gave the full story
sequence from the early stages through to the finish.</p>
<p>It was a city uncomfortably full of intrigue. A Vietnamese journa-
list told me to expect it everywhere. He said there was barely a
hotel, theatre or restaurant in Saigon that was not paying protection
money to the Viet Cong. The money was handled through Hong
Kong and reached the Communists via Cambodia. Failure to pay
the money could mean a bomb through the window.</p>
<ul>
<li>Several days before two Americans had been killed in a bomb out-
rage. The Australian military attaché, Lieutenant-Colonel Oxley,
saw it all. He was eating in a cafe on the other side of the road.
Immediately the bomb went off he knocked his wife to the floor to
get her out of danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brian Hill, the Australian Ambassador, was leading a difficult life.
During the Diem uprising there was fighting all around the Austra-
lian Embassy with bullets cutting through the garden. He hid with
his children under the dining room table. Because Australia was |
backing the U.S. in Vietnam his name was on the Viet Cong assas-
sination list. There was a permanent guard outside the Embassy and
he always travelled with a bodyguard. In the back of his car he had
two thick woollen rugs. These were not to keep him warm in steamy
Saigon; they were to smother bombs should they be thrown through
the car window. This was a use for pure Australian wool that had
yet to be mentioned by the Wool Board. |</p>
<p>Saigon at this time was filled with international reporters and it
was important to find a story that was different. A Vietnamese
journalist,who had been our local correspondent, said that if I gave
him a little time he might be able to organize an interview with the
Venerable Quang Do. Already Quang Do was a legendary figure.
He was the priest who had organized the Buddhists in their uprising</p>
<p>against the Diem Government. He had led riots in the streets; he had
been gaoled and tortured.</p>
<p>My friend managed to organize the interview in less than twenty-
four hours, much faster than I had anticipated. We drove to a temple</p>
<p>| on the outskirts of the city and there we met Quang Do in a garden.
I don’t know what I really expected. The title ‘Venerable’ seemed
an odd one. No doubt he would be a little, bent old man with a
white beard, a sort of elderly rural dean with an Asian flavour.</p>
<p>Nothing in Vietnam ever turns out as expected, but I wasn’t
prepared for the shock of the Venerable Quang Do. He could have
been a Harvard graduate. One could even have pictured him
handling the P.R. account for a big American firm. He spoke perfect
English with an American accent. His smile was warm and his
handshake friendly. His first act was to pull out a packet from under
his brown habit and offer me a cigarette —an American king size
filter. He was the smoothest monk I had ever met, and at thirty-</p>
<p>‘eight, the most handsome. | |
~ We had planned to put the interview on film for television in
Australia and I was confused.</p>
<p>‘What am I to call you?’</p>
<p>‘Anything at all, I don’t mind. If you want to be formal, call me
“Venerable”.</p>
<p>‘Why Venerable?’</p>
<p>He was entitled to be called Venerable, he said, as he had burned
an incense taper right down on to the top of his bare scalp every year
for the past twenty. This, I presumed, must have been incredibly
painful and I winced at the thought of it.</p>
<p>In a very matter of fact way he began to tell of his experiences.
He said that under Diem regime he spent three months in gaol.
During this time he was tortured continuously. They pushed salt
and soapy water into his mouth. His torturers made cunning use of
electricity and they laid him out on a table to thrash him all over
with bamboo rods.</p>
<p>“This way you learn to value freedom,’ he said. ‘We have a saying
in Buddhism — one day in gaol is worth 3,000 days of freedom.’</p>
<p>I mentioned the coloured postcards of priests incinerating them-
selves with petrol and that this was something very difficult for the
Western mind to understand.</p>
<p>“This was an important part of our campaign,’ he replied. ‘It</p>
<p>brought our cause home to the people and impressed all the world.’</p>
<p>‘But how could they do it?’ I said. ‘I wouldn’t have the courage
to burn my little finger let alone drench myself with petrol.’</p>
<p>Quang Do burst out laughing. He was being very charming and
very Harvard again. Obviously I was being quite absurd. He
explained carefully. -</p>
<p>‘It is written in the scriptures that when the Buddhist faith is
threatened, this is something we must do. There was no shortage
of volunteers. They wanted to do it and they were happy to do it.
Two were only novices, seventeen and eighteen, in the flower of -
youth. So far seven monks and one nun have died. If necessary there
will be more. |</p>
<p>| “They did not suffer. It was their opportunity to meet Buddha,
you see. When the flames were burning they were perfectly cool
because they were in a state of meditation.’</p>
<p>My expression must have betrayed my disbelief.</p>
<p>Quang Do smiled again patiently: ‘You have seen photographs.
These incidents were witnessed by as many as thirty people. In not
one case did a priest move or cry out? They were happy. When I
burn incense on my head I do not feel it.’</p>
<p>It was diflicult to know what to say. He pointed out that the body
of the first Buddhist to incinerate himself, the Venerable Quang
Duc, had been preserved as a shrine and was being worshipped by
the people in Vietnam. One nun, pretty, only twenty-four, tried to
set herself alight in one of the most expensive suites of the Hotel
Caravelle. Secret police found out about her exploit just in time.
Indeed the nuns had played a big part in the uprising. Over 100 of</p>
<p>‘them went out in the streets to gather information. And this was
interesting. They shed their habit, bought expensive wigs to cover
their shaved heads and dressed like taxi dancers, even down to their
spike heels. This was the give-away for some girls — they had never
worn high heels before.</p>
<p>Quang Do could not say exactly how many priests had died in
the clashes with Diem’s troops, but it was a fact that over 100
were still missing. Nobody knew what had happened to them.</p>
<p>Only once did the charm of the Venerable Quang Do disappear.
I said that frequently it had been written in our newspapers that
various sects of Buddhists showed Communist sympathies.</p>
<p>“Yes, they say many things,” he said. “They say we want to be the</p>
