      <description>Keith Dunstan (3 February 1925 – 11 September 2013)
Keith Dunstan’s life is not quite an open book. But there is plenty of material there. Not only in his 1990 autobiography No Brains at All, but in countless newspaper columns and features. As a writer Keith Dunstan drew on his own experience. Always with humour and a touch of self-deprecation.
He had the knack of getting his readers to feel they were his friend, as his friend Barry Humphries observed.</description>
