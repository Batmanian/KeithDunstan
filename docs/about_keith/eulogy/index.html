<p>Keith Dunstan (3 February 1925 – 11 September 2013)</p>
<p>Keith Dunstan’s life is not quite an open book. But there is plenty of material there.  Not only in his 1990 autobiography No Brains at All, but in countless newspaper columns and features. As a writer Keith Dunstan drew on his own experience. Always with humour and a touch of self-deprecation.<br>
He had the knack of getting his readers to feel they were his friend, as his friend Barry Humphries observed. Whether it was the self-deprecation, the gentle manner or the alluring turn of phrase, it was hard to tell.  Always beautifully written and punctuated in a way that made them so easy to read – as easy as eating ice-cream on a hot, summer day.
Keith Dunstan in life was as he was in his writings: a gentle, easygoing and witty man. He had a genuine enthusiasm for life. He had boyish enthusiasms, and he appreciated and found delight in the enthusiasms of others. 
We remember him particularly for his devotion to bicycling through which he helped to influence the social habits and transport options of his hometown metropolis of Melbourne. Changes which are still ongoing. 
In this he led by example, good-humouredly riding off to work on two wheels from East Malvern from the 1970s in his best gear, pitied and abused by the car-worshipping majority. 
Maybe his individualism had been steeled already through having, ever so gently, mocked Melburnians’ obsession with their particular version of football – with the Anti Football League, which he and fellow journalist Douglas Wilkie founded in 1967.
There were other enthusiasms. Like the one for wine and winemakers. That extended to growing and making good wine himself on the Mornington Peninsula. Or, Dahlia growing and wood-working. Always there was cricket watching. He loved the musty old Victorian glory of the Melbourne Club. For a while there was pipe smoking. Gadgets, Swiss Army knives, bow ties and old wind-up clocks. The Church of England was a big enthusiasm. 
And then there were enthusiasms for people, for ratbags in particular.
There was nothing derogatory in his definition of a ratbag. Ratbags were creative, often single-minded individuals. Enthusiasts like himself. He recognized these qualities in visiting celebrities like the actors Sophie Tucker and Robert Morley and in the Australian artists and intellectuals he wrote about, and who became friends, among them Barry Humphries, Xavier Herbert, Gus Nossal and Robin Boyd. And many others not so well known.
Keith would have been glad to see so many ratbags here today. 
Nothing, however, matched his devotion to his wife, Marie, and his concern for his family. My sister Kate will have more to say about this but I think it entirely true to say that his greatest enthusiasm was for his wife, Marie Rose.
That says a lot because he was a journalist through and through and that meant a lot to him as well. 
Keith Dunstan never wanted to be anything else but a journalist. His was not a private world of imaginative writing. He always believed in Samuel Johnson’s dictum that &ldquo;No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.&rdquo; 
He bemoaned the fact in his autobiography No Brains at All that he had no unhappy childhood or tortured experiences like the great Russian novelists to fall back on. 
I think that quite early in his life he reflected deeply on the craft of being a writer and how he might make something of it. He was always a reader, right to the end of his life and he learned from others. Comics got him started. But later on he read widely and he admired the great American newspaper columnists, like San Francisco’s Herb Caen. 
Introducing an early collection of Keith’s journalism, Supporting a Column, his friend and fellow columnist with the Herald, Bill Tipping, quoted the legendary sports columnist of the New York Herald Tribune, Red Smith, who said that writing a daily column was ‘the simplest thing in the world.’
All you have to do is saddle up at your typewriter every day, no matter where you are or where you’ve been the night before, and start tap, tap, tapping away – every word a drop of blood. And when you’ve filled the space, waiting there to be filled every day, as inevitable as death, you say to yourself, ‘there goes another chip off your brain Smith, but you’ve gotta eat!’
Had it not been for his military service in the Pacific war Keith Dunstan might well have become a published writer before he did. He was still serving with the RAAF when his first pseudonym appeared in print. He was &ldquo;Squee-Gee&rdquo; and it was his first go at moonlighting. 
He was still writing books and for newspapers in the last year of his life, aged eighty-eight.   (pause)
Keith Dunstan was born not far from here in East Malvern in 1925. When he was only four years old the family moved to Toorak and a few years later young Keith followed his elder brother, Bill, to Wadhurst, the preparatory school of Melbourne Grammar. Later he was sent as a boarder to Geelong Grammar, which is the subject of some of Keith’s most evocative writing and where a great Australian, the remarkable Dr James Darling was headmaster. Years later he met Darling in Collins Street, to be greeted with: ‘Hello Dunstan, still writing beastly things about me.’ 
He believed his war service in the Pacific was undistinguished and this was the reason that for many years he never marched on Anzac Day. He was disappointed at not becoming a pilot with the Air Force and believed that there were many others who were braver than he, including his elder brother Bill who is here today, and his powerful businessman father, William Dunstan VC, who was General Manager of the Herald &amp; Weekly Times Limited.
Dad always liked to spell these names out correctly. Perhaps it was the result of many bruising early encounters with sub-editors. It was always the Herald &amp; Weekly Times Limited or the Sun News-Pictorial. Even over the dinner table, trot out a cliché or a tired phrase and you would be gently called to task.
His father never wanted him to become a newspaperman. Bill Dunstan senior had a low opinion of journalists and was skeptical of his son’s career prospects if he became one.  He wanted Keith to be an engineer building the new post-war Australia. 
But the young man was determined. It was only after an interview with Herald editor Archer Thomas, that Keith was admitted furtively into the organization. His father did not question him anymore on the subject.
Thereafter it was a charmed life. The leading figure in the Herald organization was undoubtedly Sir Keith Murdoch. Young Keith did the things young journalists do, court and parliamentary reporting. Writing obituaries for those still living and who would, inevitably, pass on. He became adept at shorthand and was singled out to be one of Sir Keith Murdoch’s young men, serving as his private secretary. 
Sir Keith took an interest in his younger employees, shrewdly encouraging their careers and skills. He engineered our Keith’s first overseas posting to New York in 1949, stipulating that the young man should marry post haste if he wanted the billet. The very moral Sir Keith was not going to send a single man to a town like New York. Fortunately, this one had a girlfriend, a very accomplished nurse, Marie Rose McFadyen, and they married promptly.
It would be nearly four years before Keith and Marie Dunstan returned to Australia after stints in New York and London.  In these years their lives and their outlook were transformed. Keith discovered bow ties. He befriended and worked among brilliant expatriates, like the economist Donald Cochrane and his pianist wife Margaret Schofield, and the journalist Peter Hastings. They travelled to Italy.  In London he worked as a general reporter. My sister Jane was born following a train disaster with many deaths that he covered. He followed the 1953 Australian cricket tour of England, thinking he might become a cricket writer.
These experiences gave him confidence to take on the smaller and more restricted worlds that he had left and would return to with two children. Perhaps they helped him to better spot the trends back home with an Australia enriched by growing prosperity and  migrants from southern Europe. What with newspapers, radio and television coming in it was a good time to be a journalist.
Brisbane was a good landing place. He resigned from the Herald and got on the boat thinking he was to work for the Courier-Mail owned separately by Sir Keith Murdoch. But Sir Keith had just died and Dunstan discovered on arrival that he would be working for his old employer the Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. 
It was here that Keith Dunstan became a daily columnist, writing under the &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; front-page heading in the Courier-Mail. Brisbane was not the city in 1954 that it has since become. It was more a big country town. He made it his own journalistic territory as he would later make his larger home city of Melbourne.
Bill Dunstan VC died in 1957, aged only 62. His early death left an indelible impression on Keith. The following year he returned to Melbourne to take up the position of daily columnist with the Sun News-Pictorial, a role he was pursue for the next twenty-seven years.
He returned to a great age of newspapers with record circulations. A Place in the Sun (APITS) became a part of the city’s journalistic folklore – the Donald Bradman of columnists as how he has been generously described this past week. 
But that wasn’t all he did. Journalists were not paid all that much in those days and there were bills to pay with four indulged children. He remembered no doubt also his father’s exhortations about the poor career prospects for journalists. So he started writing for the rival Packer organization – he was Batman in the Bulletin. In &ldquo;the Bully&rdquo; he was able to write pretty much as he pleased compared to the politically conservative and very proper family oriented Herald newspaper chain headed up by Sir John Williams.
What a tyro he was for work in these years. I can remember him tap, tap, tapping away in small hours of the morning, most mornings in fact. Whether it was the history of the Melbourne Cricket Club, scripts for Hector Crawford’s radio crime program D24, columns for the Bulletin or just his Saturday feature. Then came the books: The Paddock That Grew on the MCG and Wowsers, Knockers, Sports and Ratbags – which summed up the Australian character.
Very early he realized that he could tap into the gripes and prejudices of others, as well as his own. The societies he formed are a roll call of social causes of the most enduring and amusing kind. 
He was a good observer of social trends, coming as he did out of the strait-laced world of old Melbourne with its puritanism and wowsers, prudishness, sabbatarianism, pompous businessmen and haughty professionals. He chronicled their antics and poked fun most of all at himself. 
The Exit Club was for those booted out of restaurants for not wearing a tie, or the UGH – UnGodly Horror – awards given to particularly inappropriate examples of modern architecture. Then there was the Anti Football League, his greatest heresy.
He would be up for a stunt, whether it was a new way to destroy a football or to travel to the Melbourne Cup. When John Morgan editor of the Sun suggested he ride his bicycle across America for the BiCentennial, he and my mother did it. Incredible. 
He was always alert to the prospect of a column paragraph, from family or friends or colleagues. If you had a new gadget or wine to sell or a visiting celebrity in town or an upcountry tourist attraction he was your man.
He enjoyed appearing on television on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo;. Why he did not have a big television or radio career I do not know. He spoke wonderfully, had a fine voice and could think on his feet. He applied for a political posting to go to Canberra but was knocked back. He never made it into management on the fourth floor at Flinders Street, walnut alley as his Herald journalist friend Noel Hawken contemptuously called it.
Perhaps he was too good at what he was doing, and too popular with the readers. In the end, after having done APITS for 27 Years and with his children grown up he asked for another stint overseas. He was given not his chosen San Francisco but Los Angeles.<br>
As we know he never really retired. No sooner was he at a loose end than the Age under Creighton Burns picked him up. There were more books to write, some thirty of them by last count, many of them commissioned by admirers, or done in conjunction with old friends and colleagues like the cartoonist Jeff Hook. Then came the experiment with the vineyard and autobiographies including ones on drink and bicycling.
Like most Australians the Dunstans and those who joined in were most of humble immigrant origin. Keith always believed that there two types of people in his family. They were dreamers and doers. He was clearly one of the former category. But he wanted to be one of the latter, like his very dynamic father. And in the end he was. The range of his achievements over a lifetime is extraordinary. 
We, his younger children have had difficulty keeping up. But what fun it has been and what a difference he made to this staid Old Melbourne town. 
We will miss him.</p>
