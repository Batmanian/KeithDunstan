### THE FORTRESS AFFAIR – OR SP IN THE RAW

The Bulletin 15 September 1962

Australia has always had an affection for Royal Commissions, inquiries, and such. One researcher has pointed out that since 1850 we have had 700 Royal Commissions, both State and Federal. Our colleagues and late colleagues have not shown nearly the same interest. Canada has had a mere 200, New Zealand 160 and South Africa 150. But Victoria in recent times has become the real inquiry State. We have had inquiries into fish, into the Victoria Market, into Albert Park, into bank hours and we are looking into the circumstances of a certain bridge accident.

Not many of these would interest you greatly, but for the past nine weeks we have had the Post Office Royal Commission and it is likely to go on for some time yet. This has been a beauty. We have had many an inquiry into betting, but never have we had such a brilliant picture of the life and times of SP bookies. We have had little tit-bits like the corset firm which applied for the special telephone number: 36-24-36. The corset firm did not get the number and now it is held by a private householder. We learned, too, how some SP bookies used pension forms as betting tickets, and how others used cigarette papers. Cigarette papers had these advantages over pension forms – in time of dire trouble they were easy to burn and much more pleasant to swallow and digest.

Then there were the intriguing excuses put forward. The police investigated one gentleman and asked him why he needed two telephones in his room. He was a keen punter, you see, and a man really needed two - telephones to keep in touch with his bookies. The P.M.G. investigators talked to another man who had two telephones in his hotel room. How come? Well, he was on very good terms with the girl who lived in the hotel room along the passage. The other day the girl decided to move into his quarters and when she moved, naturally, she brought her phone with her. Dr Coppel, Q.C. asked: "And did she bring her hot water bottle too?". 

And there are times when you have to be mighty smart about quoting a telephone cable. The police inquired of a lady how such a situation had come to pass. She said she tripped over it. Well, Victorian police can be skeptical. This wire ran along a wall five feet from the ground.

Mr Justice Taylor has commented that some of the situations are worthy of Damon Runyon. Take the Balaclava case of 1956. The police looked into a kitchen and there was a man reading a racing guide, a scene of perfect peace and tranquillity – except he had two telephones. They rolled hack the lino and found a wooden trapdoor. They lifted it and then levered up a steel plate. Immediately there were screams from down below. "You're electrocuting us." The plate had cut the electric light holder.
Deep down there was a concrete bunker, superbly built for the purpose, complete with telephones and all. A man and two women were making a nice Guy Fawkes bon fire of betting slips.

Or take the big SP bookie who voluntarily went into retirement and decided to show the police his premises. They were in a city warehouse. The entry to the betting room was through a maze of bales of waste. The room itself was nicely fitted out with cubicles and 11 telephones, but the feature which really gave it class was the neon lights. There were individual lights to flash on to give the warning that they were racing in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide or Brisbane.

There was the Ballarat SP bookie who had a little den in the ceiling – and the house wired throughout with microphones, and an example of SP automation - the electronic nitkeeper. There was the fellow who ran his business from a disused bank vault, but clearly the most spectacular of all was the case of the St Kilda penthouse. This was known as "The Fortress" and the bookies were illegally using 46 telephones, which originally had been installed for respectable use in the flats. The Penthouse was on the sixth floor, it was solid concrete and there was only one entrance – through a solid steel door. The police couldn't get in, even though they tried to bash it down with a sledgehammer.

The final entry would have earned the admiration of Mr Douglas Fairbanks. Constable W. G. Leaman made a daring leap six feet across to a narrow window ledge, 70 feet from the ground. Inside they found 24 people, two of whom were convicted. The time of the breaching of The Fortress was May, 1956.
The public also learnt the technique for sending out a tipster's letter. Easily the most charming was the letter from "Des Gilmore". He told his prospective clients he knew a horse that would win the Epsom and he urged them not to hesitate to send anything from £25 to £250 (certainly not more) and "Des" would place it for them at good odds then offering.

"There is not the remotest chance of this animal losing," said Des. "We are merely investing in a gilt-edged proposition." The letter ended gracefully "yours sportingly" and there was a postscript "do not forget the telephone number if possible." Mr Garvie who is assisting the Commission said it was designed for the "real suckers."

Judging from the reports the golden period for SP bookies was from 1956 to 1958. The number of telephones spotted by the police dropped from 105 in the first six months of 1958 to 35 in the same period last year. Yet regardless of the TAB there has been a slight come-back. This year the figure rose to 51.

Senior Detective Cook told the Commission that this time they were much harder to detect. The SP bookies had a small and select clientele. Rarely did they have more than one or two telephones and they operated from as many as 10 different places. Each week they moved somewhere else.

Meanwhile, in the midst of all this, Victoria's Totalisator Agency Board, issued its first annual report. The TAB had a surplus of £441,548 to share among the racing and trotting clubs. The turnover for the 12 months was £13,826,268 and next year it is expected to rise to £20,000,000. The biggest share went to the VRC which
gets £91,911. Sir Chester Manifold, late Chairman of the VRC and present TAB chairman is beaming. He says the TAB has exceeded all expectations. The SP bookies undoubtedly would agree.
