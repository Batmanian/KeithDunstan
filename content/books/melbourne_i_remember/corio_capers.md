## Corio Capers

One mellows with the years and now I look more kindly upon my years at Geelong Grammar and its famous headmaster of those years, James Darling, in particular.  It was the Bulletin editor, Peter Hastings, who urged me to write about my school years and it must have been several years after the story appeared that I met James Darling in Collins Street.  He said: "Hello Dunstan, still writing beastly things about me." Yes, the great man was astonishing.  He rarely failed to remember the name of any old boy.  I replied: "Yes, Sir James."

However I understood him much better after reading his excellent autobiography "Richly Rewarding" and in his later years we became good friends.

Bacterial Life in a Stiff Collar

The announcement that I was to go to Geelong Grammar came as a shock.  It was one of those fearful nights, when parents come to decisions.  My father said he was not satisfied with what Melbourne Grammar had done for me, nor was he satisfied with what it had done for my brother.

Then he enlarged on the charms of Geelong.  This was the finest school in the Southern Hemisphere, the Eton of Australia.  Important men sent their sons from all over the world to Geelong Grammar.  It had the teachers, a magnificent situation, and, of course, the cost was immense.  But this was something worth doing for my future.

My father was in one of his determined moods. I knew by now when decisions were irrevocable and there was no choice but to appear to be grateful.

Yet I had my opinions of Geelong Grammar.  To a 13-year-old at that time, Melbourne Grammar, beyond doubt, was THE school.  It repeatedly thrashed all others at sport.  Its record on the football field under the brilliant coach "Bully" Tavlor was superb.  The match against Scotch College was always the event of the year and any event against Geelong Grammar was considered nothing more than a mild training exercise.

The Geelong Grammar boys in their pale blue caps, hard collars and inevitable fair hair always looked slightly effeminate and we called them "a mob of poofters." Geelong never won anything except an occasional boat race and as a 13-year-old I knew that we had the finest school song, a real rabble-rouser sung to the tune of "The Men of Harlech." The chorus went:

"None our ranks shall sunder,
Who will shirk or blunder
If all are true
To our dark blue
Our foemen shall go underâ€¦
 UNDAH . . .

Whereas Geelong had a school song sung entirely in Latin to a melancholy tune that must have come from the English hymnal.  And it was true, in later years at boat races, I did find it an embarrassment having a school song that was sung in Latin, and even when I was doing Leaving Latin I wasn't entirely sure as to what it all meant.

The lonely year

So one day in February, not long before the Second World War, I was thrust into the monastic existence of boarding school.  The first year tended to be rather lonely.  Parents were allowed to visit just three times a term and one was allowed to go out on an exeat by permission of the Housemaster.

This meant that parents could pick you up after Chapel on Sunday morning and return you before dinner at 6 p.m. The thing to do was to go on a picnic to Ocean Grove, Anglesea, or, if father was feeling expansive, there was a splendid stomach-filling buffet lunch to be had at the Barwon Heads Golf Club.

As a senior school boy it was a relief to discover that I did not have to wear one of those abominable Eton collars.  For weekday wear one wore grey slacks, an open-necked blue shirt and a sports coat.

However, formal wear was necessary for Sundays, a grey suit, pale blue tie and a hard collar.

As a new boy in a junior dormitory, naturally I was the lowest form of bacterial life.  Yet as a regular reader of the "Magnet" and the "Gem" I had a fair idea what to expect.

There were five houses in the senior school based pretty much on the English system.  Four were residential and one was for day boys who came in from Geelong.  There was a list of menial duties to be carried out every day, such as cleaning out locker-rooms and such.

We weren't actually called "fags" but I was assigned to one of the House prefects for fagging duties.  I had to clean his study, wash his pots and pans, and polish his brass buttons and boots on cadet days.  There was one major difference from the fags in the "Magnet".  They always seemed to get paid, but I never got anything from my prefect except an occasional slice of toast or a piece of cake.  Yet it was a fine way of enforcing discipline.  Even now when I see that same House prefect, somewhere in a city club, he seems an immense fellow and I wonder whether I shouldn't get to work and clean his shoes or polish his buttons.

It was a spartan existence.  Corio was renowned for the savagery of its Antarctic winds in the winter. Yet there were no hot showers.  This could be something of an agony when coming in covered in mud after football, and it was compulsory to have a cold shower every morning. Personally I never found the morning cold shower much of a problem.  By developing a skilful turnabout technique one could make sure that no more than two or three drops ever fell on the bare back.

Again in the English tradition one had a weekly bath.  This took place on a rostered night and, as is often necessary in monastic institutions, it was done in threes and it was hot.  Seeing that bath night always meant half an hour less study, this was pure joy.

Some of the English public school attitudes rested with us.  I don't think there was any actual social snobbery.  We were told that in the days of Dr Francis Brown the sons of the men in trade were not welcome at Geelong, but this was no longer true.  And although we had all the wealthv from the Western district, there was no looking down on the scholarship boy.  The attitude was the reverse.  It was the fashion for some on the teaching staff to be Left-wing intellectual.

There was, though, this curious old English outlook in regard to sport.  We had a young man whose one ambition was to win the mile for Geelong Grammar.  So in those days, long before John Landy was ever a schoolboy there, he used to rise at six and pound round and round the school oval, mile after mile.

He never did win the school mile, but after his first limited successes, none of us were impressed.  "So he should, the bastard; look at all the training he did."

Caste

Then there was the well-planned caste system.  Every boy in the House was numbered, say from 68, who was the most miserable junior, up to number 1, who was the huge figure of the House Captain.  Your number was on your tuck locker, your clothes peg, everything.  And so you mounted the scale in numbers directly in accordance to seniority combined with your ability on the playing field and in the class-room.  At House assembly everyone always lined up by numbers, I to 68, and you were always rather conscious of the fact that while you were 61, Robinson was 52 and Riley was 48.

And, as in many boarding schools, there was a tradition of bullying.  This was always done very early on Saturday mornings by the gentlemen of the senior dormitories.  If it was considered that the boys in junior dormitory were becoming presumptuous, rather above themselves, they would be called upstairs for treatment.

One Saturday morning in June I was called up with six others and reprimanded.  Then I was told to put on shorts and a pair of sandshoes.  We were taken for a run a mile across the paddocks and then forced to dive into an icy mud pond and push ourselves round and round on our stomachs.

Three years later it was our turn. A group of young fellows who had been getting above themselves were called up to our dormitory.  But there was one fellow, who was afterwards to become a brilliant scholar of the Japanese language and culture, who had a bed by the door.  As the junior dormitory boys came in, he quietly told them it was a mistake and they weren't wanted. The dressing-down lapsed and the rest of us felt rather ashamed.  So there was no bullying after that and I hope on that Saturday morning the tradition ended for all time.

By the time I arrived, James Ralph Darling was already acknowledged a great headmaster.  He is now, of course, chairman of the ABC, but he looked no different then.  Except that to a small boy who only came up to his waistcoat buttons, he looked an appalling figure of authority.  He walked slightly bent with his arms behind his back and with his billowing gown and mortarboard he seemed seven feet tall.

It wasn't that he was a harsh authoritarian, he was very human, but he had an aura about him.  Whenever we were called to a special assembly to be castigated about our behavior at the boat race, or our declining morals, it was impossible to escape a sick feeling in the stomach.  Or, to be summoned to the head's study for some frightful offence, it was like walking death's row.

Behind his back we called him the Boss or simply Ralphie. In public he tended to decry the evils of school sport but whenever Geelong had a minor success on the playing field he found it impossible to hide his satisfaction completely.  He injected everything with a vast moral tone, and he urged us to enter worthy occupations where we could serve our fellow man.  In my day he cited the charms of the public service, the permanent military forces and, of course, the church.  The mere pursuit of money making was an evil which sometime made us wonder.  If we wanted to send our sons to the same expensive school what hope did we have?

The Left-wingers

We had a good deal of church prayers twice daily, and if one were a Communicant, three times on Sunday The long hours of religion along with the heavy sermons from so many visiting clerics could be an agony and maybe drove many out of the church for life.  Yet it made a real impression on some I remember my days in the school choir singing the Messiah, the Creation an even the Bach B Minor Mass in the cold but beautiful school chapel, as amongst my happiest at Corio.

Mr Darling, he was no Doctor then, could be wearing.  He was forever burning with ideas for better education and for worthy projects that utterly destroyed the school vacation.  On his staff he showed a leaning towards those with degrees from the better English universities rather than some of those with a solid grounding in local education.

As I said earlier, we had several brilliant Left-wing intellectuals on the staff.  They would talk to us of the wonders of socialism and gave us our first guilt complexes about the modern order of society There was one fellow with a marvellous academic record who used to tell us most amusingly about sex.  This indeed was exciting because sex in those days was a phenomenon that wasn't supposed to exist.  He talked, too, of the fatuity of religion and waited his moment until we came back from chapel.  His banter would go like this:

"You're late.  Why?"

"We've been at chapel, Sir."

"Huh.  Jesus racket again.  Always wasting your time when you could be learning something important.  Oh, well, I don't suppose it can do you any harm.  At least the Anglican Church provides more exercise than most.  There's an incredible amount of standing up and kneeling down."

Now this used to startle us.  How could this man survive?  Surely Mr Darling knew about his attitude?  And the presumption was: Mr Darling was perhaps a very naive fellow allowing anti-Gods and Bolshies in our tender midst.

It was only in later years that I came to realise that he must have known very well and it was merely part of his practical measures in encouraging some of his students at least to think things out for themselves.

Sometimes this could be a heady diet for 16 and 17 year olds.  School spirit was an important thing and attendance at all school and house matches was very nearly as vital as attending chapel.

One time several of us got the idea that this boosting of school spirit was the very thing that caused nationalism and hence all wars.  So on the day of a serious school match we decided to do something more important for our wellbeing and we went for a tour of the Ford factory at Geelong.

As we returned on our bicycles the whole House was waiting for us eagerly.  It was not the traditional Frog March as in the "Magnet".  They had more specialised local treatment â€“ an enforced winter swim around the rowing pond.  I had just been thrown into the water when the House Captain appeared and the lynching stopped.

The value of institutions such as Geelong Grammar is a never-ending argument.  We felt then it cost so much money that it had to be good.  The scholastic results were not always brilliant on the statistics. Melbourne High School, for example, could compare most favorably.  But then statistics were no real guide because there was a heavy leavening from the Western District and there were plenty who had no interest in scholastic honors.

It wasn't easy then to point to great old boys.  Unlike Eton, we were not running the country.  Melbourne Grammar can now point to three members of the House of Lords, Lord Baillieu, Lord Bruce and Lord Casey.  However, the next 10 years could be the most interesting for Geelong Grammar.  These will give the proof of the Darling regime, for in that time the boys of his era will be reaching to the top of their professions.  Already they are making fair progress.  There are at least four in the Federal Cabinet, and there are groups in the diplomatic service, the top teaching posts at the universities plus some very distinguished doctors and lawyers.

Boarding school, like going to the dentist, can be a most unpleasant experience.  However, if the filling remains in the tooth, then the experience can be worthwhile.

Taking the row out of rowing

Last week on the Barwon we celebrated our 100th Head of the River.  It was a bore, but first let your aged correspondent explain.  On the 17th of June, 1868, John Field, captain of Scotch College Rowing Club, walked down from Eastern Hill, through swamp and bushland, and rowed across the Yarra to deliver a challenge to Melbourne Grammar to "a friendly four-oar gig race."

Scotch won the first race by two lengths and the "Herald" reported: "The winners received a regular ovation from their school fellows.  Indeed, it was the most hearty, genuine, and impulsive cheering heard on the river for many a day."

Now 100 years later we have to be careful about our hearty and impulsive cheering.  A letter from the Chief Commissioner of Police went to every headmaster.  It said the police would be on the lookout for these specific offences: the throwing of objects at moving vehicles, the throwing of flour bombs, the climbing of fences, the defacement of property by paint or other coloring.

Scotch sent out three foolscap pages of instructions, including the letter from the Chief Commissioner, to every boy.  The receipt of all this had to be acknowledged by parents with a signature in the boy's record book.

There were such items in the circular as "No boy, except competitors, may enter or approach the boatshed area before, during, or after the Head of the River race or any other race, even if we win.  Missiles, bombs, sound-making instruments, and provocative actions are forbidden.

"It is a day when many critical eyes are turned upon us and when thoughtlessness or exultation (especially if we are successful, as we all earnestly hope) can spoil things."

Let's go back a few decades.  I don't think we ever did anything outrageous at the boat race.  There were no flour bombs in the old days.  Always we threw a few chaps in the river and souvenired a number of enemy caps, and always the day after the race the headmaster would call a special assembly of the whole school.  Standing there, forbidding, in mortar board with hands clasped over his behind and under his gown, he would commence: "What a dreadful exhibition!  I was ashamed to be associated with you yesterday."

But the boat race used to be wonderful.  It was as good as a Grand Final and almost as good as a Melbourne Cup.  It was one of the grand social events of the year.  Rowing writers had the verbosity of Neville Cardus and "Table Talk" gave it lashings of space.  A chap who was in the crew usually had stayed back until he was about 19, just so that he could get his colors, and he was a man of immense importance.  The rest' of us were on a subsistence diet like starving Asians, but the crew had to be nourished on a special fare of steak and eggs and milk.  Murray Rose, by winning all those gold medals on a diet of seaweed and birdseed, cruelly spoiled that theory.

But, as I say, the boat race was a very big deal.  Both boys and girls went in school uniform and your beloved, in her thick dark stockings, always wore your badge with about three feet of ribbon.  If you were really with it, and your parents were just down from your big property in the Riverina, you took her to lunch at the Wattle.  Otherwise you took her to Sinport's, the old basement cafe on the block.  There you gave her a "schoolgirl's dream," which was a sickly affair with a milk and ice-cream base.  If she was starving you gave her a banana parfait, which had banana, chocolate, ice-cream, nuts, whipped cream, the works.

It was fairly important to wear military boots, because there was an awful lot of jumping to be done.  Then, as soon as the race started, there was a roar from about 90,000 people, which didn't stop until the crews passed the judge's box.  If you were actually rowing, you didn't hear any individual exhortations to your school, just the roar.

Then, if your crew won, it was utterly de rigueur to rush the boatshed and exult like hell.  You shouted: "We want crew.  We want crew." Then, as they came in, everybody chanted: "Well rowed bow, well rowed two, well rowed three, well rowed four . . ." Then finally you got hold of the cox and threw him in the river.

Coxes don't get ducked any more.  That is considered far too dangerous.  After that we would go off on triumphant crocodile marches through the city.

The Geelong schools would come down on special trains, all decorated.  The school crests would be on the front of the engines, then there would be special theatre nights.  The whole school would go to the theatre, and the crew, those men of almost unapproachable distinction, sat together in the place of honor in the dress circle.

In 1948 the Swan Street Bridge was going up across the Yarra, so the race took place on the Barwon.  The headmasters felt it was quieter down there.  The race needed toning down as a big social event.  So, except for one year, it has been on the Barwon ever since.

Oh, it has had a few moments.  In 1955 a man was so excited after a win by Geelong College he tried to swim the river and nearly drowned.  Then 1956 was a bad year with the throwing of flour bombs, tomatoes, and eggs.  Then in 1957 there were brawls, more flour bombs, and a Wesley old boy was hit over the head with a baseball bat and taken to hospital with a suspect fractured skull.  In the wet year of 1960 they developed the ultimate refinement, the chocolate flour bomb.  This was flour mixed with cocoa.

It was fear of all this that brought in the dire restrictions for the centenary year.  Your correspondent noted a number of changes from the 'thirties.  In the old days the boat race was so social one really dressed for the occasion.

No doubt, they still do in a way.  Girls were there in shorts, boots, fishnet stockings, and there were even a few school old boys in bare feet.  The crowd was estimated at 28,000 and there was only one untoward incident.  Some misguided fellow let off a smoke bomb and the police closed in so fast you would have thought they were defending President Johnson.

The lavatory facilities were shocking and this is something the Geelong Council might consider before the second centenary.  On the far bank there was one establishment for the ladies, and, if we coin a phrase, the course through the queue for this Head of the River took 34 minutes.

The cheering throughout was middling quiet and the behaviour of the Scotch boys was exemplary at all times.  You will be pleased to hear they did not exult over much.

During the week there was just one piece of pageantry.  Scotch rowed over to Melbourne, just as they did 100 years ago.  In almost the identical words of John Field they issued a challenge, not to a friendly boat race but to a friendly dinner at the Windsor Hotel, which must have been very satisfying, for they won the Head of the River, as they did in 1868, comfortably.
