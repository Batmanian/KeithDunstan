## 7.1.	General and recycling
Except for Level 1, there are two rubbish rooms, located at the northern and southern end of each level. The rubbish rooms include separate bins for recycling. Residents should sort domestic rubbish, mixed recycling waste and cardboard waste, and place it in the appropriate bins.
## 7.2.	Hard waste
Hard waste (large items, such as appliances) is generally collected every three months. The Building Manager will notify residents when a collection is imminent. 
Hard waste is placed by residents in a designated area at the rear south west corner of the building, adjacent to the railway viaduct, and near the car park southern entrance. 
## 7.3.	Charity waste
Two charity bins for recycled clothing and other re-useable items are located on Level 1 of the car park, adjacent to the stairs.
