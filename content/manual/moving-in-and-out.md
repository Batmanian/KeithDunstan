Where moving in and out of the Grand Central includes moving furniture and other bulky items, the move must be coordinated with the Building Manager. A loading bay is available near the southern entrance to the rear car park, where moving vans and trucks may be unloaded and loaded.

When moving in for the first time, the Building Manager will provide new residents with induction training, including where to place rubbish, how to access the building and common areas (such as the barbecues and swimming pool), and where to get mail, etc.

The move in, move out and induction details are shown in Annex 1.
