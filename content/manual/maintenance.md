## 8.1.	Plumbing and drainage
Plumbing and drainage within an apartment is the responsibility of the Lot Owner. This includes leaking taps, burst hot water services and blocked drains.

Where water is entering an apartment from an adjacent apartment, then the Owners Corporation may investigate the cause of the leak and have the leak stopped to prevent damage. Such leaks will be investigated to determine the cause. 
Where a leak is caused by a failure of common property, then the Owners Corporation will pay for the costs of rectification. 

Where the leak is caused by pipes or drains for which the Lot Owner is responsible (including drainage pipes leading to the main plumbing riser pipe), then the Lot Owner will need to pay for the repairs. This may include costs incurred by the Owners Corporation to determine the cause of the problem and effect repairs.
## 8.2.	Electricity
Electricity supply to each apartment is the responsibility of the Lot Owner. Where electricity supply to an apartment fails, then the Lot Owner should contact their electricity service provider. Lot Owners may also need to contact a registered electrician to determine the root cause of the failure and to effect repairs.
## 8.3.	Telephone and internet
Telephone and internet services to an apartment is the responsibility of the Lot Owner. This includes the cabling from the MDF room to each apartment.
