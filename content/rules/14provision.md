## 14.2	Support of Services

## 14.3	Metering of Services
Where Lot Owners' Lots are not separately metered in relation to services, including but not limited to gas, electricity and / or water, Lot Owners shall pay a portion of such service and supply charges relating to the service on a proportional rate derived by dividing Lot Owners' unit liability with respect to the Lot Owners' Lot by the total unit liability of all Lots serviced jointly and by no other reference.

## 14.4	Apportionment of Costs of Services
(a)	The Owners Corporation must not seek payment or reimbursement for a cost or charge from a Lot Owner or Occupier that is more than the amount that the supplier would have charged the Lot Owner or Occupier for the same goods or services.

(c)	Rule 14.4(b) does not apply if the concession or rebate:

(i)	must be claimed by the Lot Owner or Occupier and the Owners Corporation has given the Lot Owner or Occupier an opportunity to claim it and the Lot Owner or Occupier has not done so by the payment date set by the relevant supplier; or

(ii)	is paid directly to the Lot Owner or Occupier as a refund.

## 14.5	Maintenance and Upgrading of Services
