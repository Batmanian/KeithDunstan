        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Dunstan was born in East Malvern, Victoria, the son of journalist and Victoria Cross recipient, William Dunstan, and
          his wife Marjorie. He attended Melbourne Grammar School and Geelong Grammar School and was a flight lieutenant in the
          Royal Australian Air Force from 1943–46, stationed at Labuan in the Pacific.</p>
        <h2>As a journalist</h2>
        <p>In 1946 Dunstan joined The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, publishers of The Sun News-Pictorial and The Herald (since
          merged as the Herald Sun). He was Foreign Correspondent for the H&WT with posts in New York (1949–52) and London
          (1952–54). This period was followed by a position with The Courier-Mail for which he wrote a column "Day by Day". He
          returned to Melbourne and from 1958 to 1978 contributed a daily column, "A Place in the Sun" for The Sun News-Pictorial,
          the city’s largest circulating daily newspaper. During these years his popularity grew and he became a Melbourne
          institution.</p>
        <p>From 1962 he wrote regularly for the Sydney-based weekly magazine The Bulletin under the pseudonym of Batman, after
          the city’s controversial founder, John Batman. He also wrote for the travel magazine Walkabout and

        <p>He published a quartet of books on Australian character: Wowsers (1968), Knockers (1972), Sports (1973) and Ratbags
          (1979) and many works of history on popular subjects ranging from wine to sport to retailing, and including an
          unfashionably critical study of the Australian outlaw Ned Kelly, Saint Ned (1980).</p>
        <p>
